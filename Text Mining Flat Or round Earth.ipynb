      "Eratosthenes calculated the Earth's circumference without leaving Egypt. He knew that at local noon on the summer solstice in Syene (modern Aswan, Egypt), the Sun was directly overhead. (Syene is at latitude 24°05′ North, near to the Tropic of Cancer, which was 23°42′ North in 100 BC[17]) He knew this because the shadow of someone looking down a deep well at that time in Syene blocked the reflection of the Sun on the water. He then measured the Sun's angle of elevation at noon in Alexandria by using a vertical rod, known as a gnomon, and measuring the length of its shadow on the ground.[18] Using the length of the rod, and the length of the shadow, as the legs of a triangle, he calculated the angle of the sun's rays.[19] This turned out to be about 7°, or 1/50th the circumference of a circle. Taking the Earth as spherical, and knowing both the distance and direction of Syene, he concluded that the Earth's circumference was fifty times that distance.\n",

Lay out the complete issues and admit where scientist lie or have change their data or have concealed information to the public. Lets talk about geocentrisim and how scientists have lied about acting as if the world rotates when it in fact does not. Your video tries to make flat earthers as being just idiots and yet they have real issues you guys who make these type of videos are to affraid to confront. And for this reason I am ashamed of your version of presenting the facts. Has NASA lied or withheld information or deleted posts from their website? You cant pretend scientist are all truthful and act like they all have told no lies. Either present the full truth or just stay out of the conversation because mocking or presenting partial points is not fair nor acceptable.

The English word \"Minister\" means \"Servant\", but that's not what a Minister IS. It's not him to serve the people, but it's the people who serve him. Science MEANS \"knowledge\", but what it really is - is  GUESSING and EXPLORING. Science is based upon BELIEF. People BELIEVE what Science tells them. They do NOT KNOW any of those things claimed by Science, they BELIEVE what it tells them. In order to KNOW they would have to engage their 5 senses. You know your friends, there is no need for Science or Religion to tell you who your friends are. You don't know how old the Earth is, so Science has to tell you that is 4,6 Billion years old, and your Church has to tell you that it is 6,000 years old, and you will choose which instance you will BELIEVE. if you choose to BELIEVE your Church, you will call it KNOWLEDGE, because it is based upon an ALL-KNOWING GOD. If you choose to BELIEVE in Science, you will call it KNOWLEDGE because it is based upon the ALL-KNOWING SCIENCE, or upon the fact that the word \"Science\" purely linguistically means \"knowledge\".\n",

      " @Hello Vicki , my friend, do you think the Vikings had a Globe Earth map on their Drakkars when they went to America? Compared to all those thousands and thousands of years, when people would sail the world believing it was flat, those 200 years during which some sailors believed the Earth was a Globe are nothing. Sailing across the world is absolutely possible on any shape of the Earth. Sextants are not dependent on a spherical Earth, for if they were, they wouldn't have been invented by people who believed the Earth was flat. A sextant considers the Polaris, and it works whether people believe it's a star or just a light in the firmament. A sextant can determine the longitude, regardless if people place it onto a flat Earth or a globe Earth map, because longitude is longitude on both maps. If you start your sailing on a boat, you will get from Europe to America regardless whether you believe you're sailing on a flat Earth or on a Globe, because it makes no difference. If it made a difference, ancient people would have never been able to make long journeys on Sea, because they believed the Earth was flat and their devices worked although they were not \"adjusted\" to a spherical Earth\n",

But that again would be highly problematic, because if such a flight happened and people could see that the Earth is not a Globe, those people addicted to Science will start to object, claiming that the flight was fake!

I have, and no curvature was observable. But if you refer to 30,000 meters over the Ocean, I don't know what can be observed from there, because I have never been that high. Have you?

The reason the ocean is curved is because it’s being pulled towards the center of the earth. Even globebusters made the mistake of admitting that you can’t see the bottom of Santa Barbara Island from Beverly Hills from an elevation of 565 feet. They claimed that according to the earth curvature calculator it shouldn’t be visible at all then they said “but you can clearly see “the majority” of the island. If the earth was flat you’d be able to see all of it including the beach on the island but you can’t because it’s blocked by the curvature of the earth. They also made another mistake when discussing the Nat Geo video where they were testing the curvature of the earth at the Salton lake in California by saying that the boat hadn’t reached the horizon yet which they were correct the boat hadn’t reached the horizon but on a flat earth looking over water there shouldn’t be a horizon in the first place. By admitting that there is a horizon on a lake they already admitted that the horizon does exist thereby confirming that the earth is a sphere and not flat. If the earth was flat you’d be able to see the bank on the other side of the lake. This just goes to show that even when flat earthers see the evidence for themselves they still reject it\n",

      "On 4th December there was a total solar eclipse which was visible only in extreme South locations, particularly Antarctica. It was streamed live from the Union Glacier Base near the shores of the Weddell Sea, which is basically south of South America, on several websites including NASA's.  In addition to over 70 people who travelled there to watch it, two plane loads of eclipse chasers, from Western Australia and Chile (on opposite sides of the disc) flew South to get a good view of it from 30,000 feet. It was also observed as a partial eclipse from South Africa and Melbourne.\n",

      "When it was observed in Australia it was just before sunset and people looked West to watch it. In contrast, folks in South Africa had to look Eastwards as it was early morning. \n",

      "But here's the BIG THING. The people observing it from the Union Glacier Base watched it when it was technically around midnight! At this time of the year the sun doesn't set in Antartica. It just goes around in circles about 15 degrees above the horizon. And to film the eclipse, the cameras streaming it were pointed SOUTH! Over the South Pole! In the opposite direction to the \"centre of the disc\"!\n",

      "The real problem is people don't like to feel insignificant. They'll often search for ways to suggest that there is inherent meaning in their lives. Many people do not want to accept the reality that they are not intrinsically important. When you search, keep asking questions, keep going deeper, your still faced with the same, inherent issues if you follow flat Earth conspiracies. How did whatever beings that lay beyond the flat Earth come into existence? What are their laws of physics like, then, if they do not live in a manufactured environment, as we apparently do? If the beings outside of the flat Earth dome are born in whatever natural way the outer universe sees fit, then what gives them the significance that we are searching for? Then the question is: if an insignificant (natural, randomly formed) \"Creator\" created us, doesn't that make us even less significant? Those who believe in the flat Earth claim significance by something larger forming us, but that larger being does not have the same advantage to believe in itself. It releases a burden from peoples' lives to believe in the flat Earth conspiracy, and other similar ideas like it, until you keep looking deeper. The truth that we are not significant may hurt at first, until you realize that the real freeing thing is that you can define what significance means to you (both in terms of what is important to you, and what kind of ideas of self you want to be known/remembered), you choose what matters in your life, and you can have the impact your searching for, because you are not bounded by anything but yourself. Your life as an individual is interpreted entirely differently from that of another, you may give significance to your family, your friends, your ideals, but another individual may never even have contact with anything from your life, not even having the opportunity to deem it as good or bad, because it truly is that insignificant to them. The choice of what you define to be important in your life is taken away if you believe that there is something grand out there, orchestrating all of known reality.\n",

well at that time in Syene blocked the reflection of the Sun on the water  He then measured the Sun s angle of elevation at noon in Alexandria by using a vertical rod  known as a gnomon  and measuring the length of its shadow on the ground      Using the length of the rod  and the length of the shadow  as the legs of a triangle  he calculated the angle of the sun s rays      This turned out to be about     or     th the circumference of a circle  Taking the Earth as spherical  and knowing both the distance and direction of Syene  he concluded that the Earth s circumference was fifty times that

claimed by Science  they BELIEVE what it tells them  In order to KNOW they would have to engage their   senses  You know your friends  there is no need for Science or Religion to tell you who your

my friend  do you think the Vikings had a Globe Earth map on their Drakkars when they went to America  Compared to all those thousands and thousands of years  when people would sail the world believing it was flat  those     years during which some sailors believed the Earth was a Globe are nothing  Sailing across the world is absolutely possible on any shape of the Earth  Sextants are not dependent on a spherical Earth  for if they were  they wouldn t have been invented by people who believed the Earth was flat  A sextant considers the Polaris  and it works whether people believe it s a star or just a light in the firmament  A sextant can determine the longitude  regardless if people place it onto a flat Earth or a globe Earth map  because longitude is longitude on both maps  If you start your sailing on a boat  you will get from Europe to America regardless whether you believe you re sailing on a flat Earth or on a Globe  because it makes no difference  If it made a difference  ancient people would have never been able to make long journeys on Sea  because they believed the Earth was flat and their devices worked although they were not  adjusted  to a spherical Earth      Mikewiththebluecar Mikewiththebluecar il y a   semaines   Smooth Drops  no one has flown around the world  People have been doing that for over half a century  I flew from Dallas to Korea

 why would anyone need to fly from pole to pole  To prove that the earth is a sphere  They ve proven that over and over again and it s not like it would make any difference if someone had because flat

Mikewiththebluecar  Being on a plane won t prove the shape of the Earth  if you have any knowledge at all   Also  the fact that someone has travel the Earth east to west or vice versa doesn t prove

because it would be either completely faked or  accompanied  by lots of fake info  such as footages produced in a studio prior to the flight  Actually  ANY long distance flight could prove that the Earth is not spherical  if it was performed by honest people  But that again would be highly problematic  because if such a flight happened and people could see that the Earth is not a Globe  those people addicted to Science will start to object  claiming that the flight was fake  Fact is  nobody can ever prove anything   at least not to those who stick to an  infused  world view  regardless if it is the BELIEF about a flat Earth or the BELIEF about a Globe     Mikewiththebluecar Mikewiththebluecar il y a   semaines   Predrag L  you can see the curvature of the earth when your flying at        feet over the ocean  You can see the curvature of the earth as ships go over the horizon  It s not hard to prove at all     Predrag L Predrag L il y a   semaines   Mikewiththebluecar  So  I have never claimed that the Earth wasn t CURVED  In my opinion the Earth is BULGED yet not spherical  It looks like a      of a sphere  You know that there is a sphere and a hemisphere  so just go further than that and imagine a sixteenth sphere  Besides  have you been at        feet over the Ocean  I have  and no curvature was observable  But if you refer to        meters over the Ocean  I don t know what can be observed from there  because I have never been that high  Have you  Besides  even if the curvature can be observable from such a height  it doesn t disprove my understanding  because the Earth need not be a full sphere so as to be curved        Mikewiththebluecar Mikewiththebluecar il y a   semaines   Predrag L  I have been        feet above the ocean before several times flying to   from Hawaii and the Philippines and I could definitely see a curve in the ocean which wouldn t have any curve at all if the earth was flat because water is self leveling  The reason the ocean is curved is because it s being pulled towards the center of the earth  Even globebusters made the mistake of admitting that you can t see the bottom of Santa Barbara Island from Beverly Hills from an elevation of     feet  They claimed that according to the earth curvature calculator it shouldn t be visible at all then they said  but you can clearly see  the majority  of the island  If the earth was flat you d be able to see all of it including the beach on the island but you can t because it s blocked by the curvature of the earth  They also made another mistake when discussing the Nat Geo video where they were testing the curvature of the earth at the Salton lake in California by saying that the boat hadn t reached the horizon yet which they were correct the boat hadn t reached the horizon but on a flat earth looking over water there shouldn t be a horizon in the first place  By admitting that there is a horizon on a lake they already admitted that the horizon does exist thereby confirming that the earth is a sphere and not flat  If the earth was flat you d be able to see the bank on the other side of the lake  This just goes to show that even when flat earthers see the evidence for themselves they still reject it    Mikewiththebluecar Mikewiththebluecar il y a   semaines   Predrag L  why would water  bulge  on a flat earth  Sure there would be waves but not a bugle

watch it  two plane loads of eclipse chasers  from Western Australia and Chile  on opposite sides of the disc  flew South to get a good view of it from        feet  It was also observed as a partial eclipse from South Africa and Melbourne   When it was observed in Australia it was just before sunset and people looked West to watch it  In contrast  folks in South Africa had to look Eastwards as it was early morning    But here s the BIG THING  The people observing it from the Union Glacier Base watched it when it was technically around midnight  At this time of the year the sun doesn t set in Antartica  It just goes around in circles about    degrees above the horizon  And to film the eclipse  the cameras streaming it were pointed SOUTH  Over the South Pole  In the opposite direction to the  centre of the disc    When totality was happening over Antarctica  it was around noon in India  The sun would have been at it s highest in the Indian sky   How is all of this  happening MORE OR

their lives  Many people do not want to accept the reality that they are not intrinsically important  When you search  keep asking questions  keep going deeper  your still faced with the same  inherent issues if you follow flat Earth conspiracies  How did whatever beings that lay beyond the flat Earth come into existence  What are their laws of physics like  then  if they do not live in a manufactured environment  as we apparently do  If the beings outside of the flat Earth dome are born in whatever natural way the outer universe sees fit  then what gives them the significance that we are searching for  Then the question is  if an insignificant  natural  randomly formed   Creator  created us  doesn t that make us even less significant  Those who believe in the flat Earth claim significance by something larger forming us  but that larger being does not have the same advantage to believe in itself  It releases a burden from peoples  lives to believe in the flat Earth conspiracy  and other similar ideas like it  until you keep looking deeper  The truth that we are not significant may hurt at first  until you realize that the real freeing thing is that you can define what significance means to you  both in terms of what is important to you  and what kind of ideas of self you want to be known remembered   you choose what matters in your life  and you can have the impact your searching for  because you are not bounded by anything but yourself  Your life as an individual is interpreted entirely differently from that of another  you may give significance to your family  your friends  your ideals  but another individual may never even have contact with anything from your life  not even having the opportunity to deem it as good or bad  because it truly is that insignificant to them  The choice of what you define to be important in your life is taken away if you believe that there is something grand out there  orchestrating all of known reality

combat it  And they ll keep coming up with odder and odder excuses  even ones that are patently ridiculous  rather than give up this idea that makes them feel like they re special because they know   the truth    The best you can do  I think  is to get a lot of detail about what he believes and try to find a contradiction in it  Like  many of them believe the Sun is a small  close globe that circles around and shines down like a spotlight  Two easily verifiable contradictions of this are a  the Sun sets  and b  it never changes its apparent size in the sky  even though  according to the flat Earth model  its distance varies considerably throughout a day  One nice direct method is to set up a camera pointing out to a sea horizon on a clear day  preferably from a good height  then add a spirit level to the view and line it up against the horizon  If you take a photo and then horizontally  but not vertically  compress the image  the curvature is pretty easy to see against the straight spirit level  this rules out any in camera effect     Most often the reasons to join a conspiracy theory are not the misleading arguments  It s to join a group finding fellas or and the feeling of being significant and not believing that while facing big problems the government people does do nothing  That said  one obvious fact would be that in a time lapse the stars on the northern hemisphere and the stars on the south hemisphere rotate in different directions  Different people on different southern continent  Africa  South America  Australia  can see the southern cross  a star constellation  at the same time  Wouldn t be possible on a plain  Also the Southern cross cannot be seen from nordern hemisphere  The north star cannot be seen by the southern hemisphere    Ask them how gravity works  The typical response from flat earthers is that the disk earth is accelerating upwards at     ms s  In reality  g  the local gravitational field strength  varies by around    due to the fact that the earth is technically an oblate spheroid and differences in rock density in different areas  As far as I m aware  there is no flat earth model that can explain this    The problem with flat Earthers is not that they believe the earth is flat  It   s their destructive combination of boredom  Mis placed search for meaning  Pride  and stubbornness  My advice is to model the virtues contrary to those vices  suggest ways of finding meaning and community that compete with the flat earthers and show the kind of respect for them as a person that will make them feel more comfortable changing their view in light of your arguments    Flat earthers seem to like those kind of experiments that are performed by everyday people and simple enough to be understood without any prior knoweledge so I d show your friend this linked video   and another proof for his axiom  It s the Eratosthenes proof with just   sticks and a bike  He could still claim this video is fake and was posted by a goverment agency to confuse you  This os the problem with your average flat earther  it s the same as Descartes and its demiurge  if you assume theres an all powerful entity thats trying to shield the truth from you  the evil demiurge demon for Descartes or the goverment for your friend  then any argument against what you believe the truth is will be shutdown automaticaly becuase the all powerfull evil entity has always the upper hand  This types of theories can never be proven right or wrong and thats why we don t consider them scientific  in the end you have to deal with things that you can test and prove    I ve tried this before with a flatearther  Their flat earth model looks like a polar map with an impenetrable ice wall  Antarctica  forming the circular boundary of the disc  The sun supposedly circles the disc overhead  My argument was to ask them to simply explain how sunsets work since  in their model  there should always be a line of sight to the sun no matter where you are on the disc  I got accused of being closed minded and brainwashed and no opinions were changed  The person I argued with held many other pseudoscientific beliefs besides being a flatearther  so I think the core belief is more like a general distrust of science   My favourite  the moon is upside down in Australia   I m not sure a setting sun will convince him the earth isn t flat as they do seem to come up with some odd excuses to combat it  That s unfortunate  as   what s blocking your view when the sun is setting   would be the first thing I d try  With   where is the sun at night   as the next line of attack  But when somebody does not get to a position by logic  you can t get them out of that position by logic   Does he believe that the moon and sun are globes  If so  you could say that the earth would be like that   Is there someone he trusts who lives at least a few hundred miles to the east or west  Have them talk on the phone near sunset and find out that the sun isn t setting at the same time  If that doesn t convince him  nothing will   You can t  Most of them believe in flat earth for the religious reason that if God did not create flat earth  then humans are just another life form when they just know humans were created by God to be His special snowflakes  Ask them if they   ve ever seen an eclipse that isn   t circular  You can t  These people aren t open to being convinced or having their minds changed  Their belief isn t rooted in mistaken facts that you can correct  There s nothing you can say and no proof you can offer that they won t dismiss as fake or reason their way out of  Everything just gets woven into the conspiracy  You ll just be wasting your time and energy  Don t associate with moroons  Circumpolar Star Variation by latitude Slinky dropping shows gravity not upward acceleration Flight Times from Argentina to South Africa Eclipse Path Prediction  thousands of years into the past or future  Analemma Different Day and Night lengths for different latitudes The Sun Sets   Why do you care  He s either messing with you or too far gone  Find people who want to enjoy real life and go put your energy into being with them   In psychology there   s a thing called motivated reasoning  where people are motivated to form their opinions based almost completely on their emotions  Even when new facts are introduced motivated reasoning will keep an individual from changing their mind because their subjective reality is more important to them than the objective reality around them  I liked the video of the flat earthers that went out on a big lake with a bright light on a boat at night and binoculars on shore to    prove    their theory  They were surprised by the fact the couldn   t find the light unless they raised it up on the boat  The moon appears upside down in the southern hemisphere  compared to the northern hemisphere  You need to let this friend go  and find another friend  Maybe find a friend that isn t so stupid  Ask him how he explains sunrise sunset  sun disappearing below the horizon from the bottom  and timezones at the same time You should understand that you don   t need to convince anyone  you can only share scientific sources and it   s up to your friend to accept it or not  I don t think he s going to change his view that NASA lied  I wonder if you can fight conspiracies with more conspiracies  Maybe the reason they lied was for something else     I dunno  It was too hard so they all just drank beer and got some interns to make the images  Imagine how good of a party you could throw with all that money  yeah that was it  a secret company wide party with all the booze you can handle  If they say that every proof you offer is faked  it s going to be hard to do that   Ya good luck convincing your friend     As I ve also mentioned here a few times  In the end  this is question for you to pose to ask psychnology rather than ask physics  You can talk about rational  well accepted  rigorously proven  endlessly photographed from space kind of physics with your friend all night long  until the cows come home in the morning light  but he still will NEVER EVER believe you  Thus the fact that all this is about psychology and not physics  This is a also a possibly bad sign about your friend s mental health  unfortunately     NOTE  People who are prone to this kind of obviously bizarre and outlandish conspiracy thinking are more susceptible and vulnerable to even more dangerous irrational cult like thinking  They often embrace this strange thinking because inside they believe it makes them   special   and   better      That they somehow have profound knowledge that the rest of us don t know because we re all too dim or foolish to see the   greater truth   that they  in their enlightened uprisen intelligence and wisdom see  They walk around seeing themselves as the greater wise ones  when in reality rather than this making them seem special in a positive way in the eyes of others  it instead only makes them stand out in a glaring repulsive cringe foolish way    Yeah I had a friend who fell down that particular rabbit hole  You won t win any debates by throwing facts in their face or telling them they re wrong  Ask questions  be earnestly interested and ask them how it works  For example  What makes you think the world is flat  How does the flat earth theory work  Where did you hear about flat earth  What makes you trust those sources  Why do you distrust sources that say otherwise  Try to avoid giving your own conclusions  leading them  or condescending them in any way  They probably won t leave the conversation saying they ve changed their mind  But you ll sow the seed of doubt in their belief that they may reflect on    I mean  you could flip it around and just ask them to show you the edge of our flat Earth  Or have them explain why does the force of gravity always point straight down  no matter where you are  On a disk  it would pull towards its middle  so the closer you are to the edge  the more it would point sideways  They  of course  won t do that because they don t want to be reasoned with and the odd excuses are a proof of that    I don t think that any argument will convince them since it s not really a scientific issue  It s a psychological and political issue  If one believes that there is a conspiracy whose goal is to hide truth from the rest of the population  then one cannot trust anybody  Any argument that uses standard science will not be trusted because standard science  in their opinion  is one way the conspiracy brainwashes us  They will never believe standard science unless they find the evidence for themselves  They basically would like to rebuild science from scratch on their own  The real problem is trusting other people    First have him watch Behind the Curve on netflix  at the very least he ll pick up some sweet hammer trick skills  My personal favorite would be to send him up in a weather balloon like redbull challenge dude so he can sky dive from the edge of space  If your friend wants to know  there is a really easy way  Draw a reaaaaly big triangle on Earth  If the angles add up to     degrees  then the Earth is flat  If they add up to more than     degrees  then the earth has a curved surface  with some fancy math  it can be shown that it is a sphere  If they add up to less than     degrees  Earth is a likely a hyperbolic saddle point  Another thing he can do is simple fucking math  Go to somewhere flat and pick a tall ass land mark  Get it s height  Now walk away in literally any direction until you can t see it  curvature of Earth  horizon   Measure the distances and you can come up with a reasonable estimate for the radius of curvature based upon some trigonmetry  He could try setting up a foucault pendulum  Get his ass a non stop flight trip that goes most of the way around the world and have him try to figure out how he s experiencing       hrs of day light  He could try firing a bullet with a tracer round parallel to the ground on a clear day with a high powered scope and rifle  after a km or so of flight  the Coriolis effect will kick become obvious as the bullet starts to drift to the left or right  depending on the direction you fire it   He could try to explain why sunsets are red  He could do the thing they did on behind curve with a laser  He can try to explain how we don t detect the four elephants standing on the back of a giant turtle which supports the flat earth  not to mention the depths below  it s turtles all the way down after that point   There are a million ways  your friend doesn t care whether it is or not  he just wants to be accepted and be part of an ingroup  Find him a new ingroup   i know youre probably asking for a nice physics y answer  but might i try a different approach  ask ur friend if they would go to an  ends edge of the earth  theme park set on the ends of the flat earth  and then ask why they ve never heard of that kind of place existing  don t you think  if the earth really were flat  and that the ends of the earth did exist  we d have heard of some company making money off of it by now   only half joking tbh maybe it might work   Maybe mention some small things  Like the E  tv  s effect  where something that s moving East is percieved as lighter than when moving west  This is because of the change in the objects angular velocity as it travels with the rotating earth   Obviusly the mass doesn t change but the imaginary centrifugal force pointed outwards becomes greater or smaller  And this difference is obviously really small  But it s measurable  I d personally think that small things like this that are measurable if you try hard enough might go a long way as an argument  But I ve never met someone who actually thinks the earth is flat so I don t actually know how well it would work   I might have explained this inaccurately I d recommend you look it up yourself   There are enough proofs  but does he she really want to know the truth or is he she in denial  Helium balloon and a go pro might work  You can even see the curve if you got sea on the horizon  I ve always wanted to try a cross country trip where you find the biggest square you can drive  Plot the distance you drove on a plane and the beginning and end points of the journey should not match up  And on a Mercator projection  it should be distorted and not look like a square anymore  Some cars even have a built in compass to go along with the odometer to help you track it without using GPS which could be explained away as government controlled  What I really want to do is write some Arduino code to log it all for me to increase accuracy since no roads are going to be perfectly straight for the journey  Get a digital compass or accelerometer module to register direction and either a radar or tachometer module to register speed  Plot the course and log it to an SD card  You should be able to dump it into Excel and graph it fairly easily  You get a vacation together  you get to see some sights  and you should frame it as you don t know how it will turn out  That you re in it to find out together  If you get in a car for   weeks together and they know you re only doing it to prove them wrong  that s gonna be an awkward vacation I bet  I don t know where you are  but the US has some big  wide open spaces to try this  Don   t bother  the evidence is out there it is just they don   t want to look at it  Lost cause  Either just let it go or stop associating with unreasonable people  If you have a drone you can send it up just after sunset and still be able to see the sun  Dan Olson s in search of a flat earth on YouTube might help you  same with beyond the curve on Netflix  neither are short though  good luck The most convincing way is with the star rotation  but you would need someone in the other hemisphere  They are seen as opposite rotations and is not possible to explain with any flat earth theory Send him this link  Folding Ideas  In Search of A Flat Earth does a good job Easy  Ask them to explain a Foucault pendulum on a flat Earth that doesnt rotate  Smash his head into a wall maybe that will fix it Don   t waste your time on this sort of person  they   ve already made up their mind  you won   t be able to change it Watch the sun set  then go to a higher place and watch ir set again Is that friend slot fungible  Ask him what he thinks astronomers  physicists  astrophysicists  aero astrospace engineers  etc   actually do  What are they being paid for  What are they researching  Is every one of these people lying about their job and their research  How have none of these people ever come out with the    truth    about the earth actually being flat and that millions of jobs are coverups  That   s because there haven   t been  Now who has the proof now  He can   t argue around this one without defying his own logic  This isn   t dealing with physical evidence  it is dealing with probability and reason  If he can   t see this  then ask him if he has done any of his own research to prove that the earth is flat  or has he just listened to others say it is  Again  if he hasn   t done any research  if he defies this  he is defying his own logic  Therapy   Here s a few quick and easy ones  Blow a big soap bubble for them and show them how it s round and not flat  This is the same mechanic that makes the earth round  A sphere is the natural shape to hold the most volume in the least amount of space  It works for soap bubbles  it works for planets  ask them how the day night cycle would even be possible on a flat disc  Point out the fact that a single light source  like a hanging lightbulb  lights up an entire room  Not just a cone shape of light  Flat earthers like to think that the sun is super small and super close  but that doesn t disprove day night cycles since the disc would still be lit up      of the time regardless if the earth was flat  You can t have some sections lit up  and some sections in darkness with a flat disc  gravity would be drastically different at the edges of the disc than it would be closer to the center  People at the center would experience much higher gravity  We do not observe that at all how are we able to see different constilations in the night sky in different hemispheres if the earth was flat  If it was flat  then we would all see the same constilations everywhere at the same time  Can t exactly look behind the disc we are standing on    As there is a big disc in the way   Don   t even try   they sound really stupid     Friend      Honestly  it   s probably not worth your time  depending on his age  I hate seeing science channels on YouTube constantly debating flat earthers who are grown adults  It   s a waste of time  and honestly  it   s upsetting  They should use their platform to teach people with an open mind science   not debate people who will never change their mind  The net utility is basically zero debating those dunces  whereas producing educational videos may educate thousands upon thousands of people   Don t  Get better friends   You know how the earth is illuminated right  Depending on the season  north or south might get more less sunlight  but we can just take the winter scenario to make our point more obvious  On a globe earth model  it makes perfect sense for it to be bright where it s bright and dark where it s dark because it s common sense and we can observe it with any round object under a light source  Try drawing the dark and bright zones on a flat earth model  Now I don t know if he might have the mental capacity to imagine how it would look like  but if you draw it you would get a map where it s dark in the very centre  the north pole  while almost the entirety of the edges are bright  south pole  No stretch of imagination or mental gymnastics that I have seen can make this seem plausible in any way  If he has any open mindedness or at least enough intelligence to understand why that drawing is the way it is  you might covert him  Alternatively  he ll just accuse you of lying if he doesn t understand basic logic  rather probable  or just make something up dodge the topic if he realizes the fragility of his claim and start clinging to other points while disregarding a massive problem with his model   One of the best things you can do is remind them  this isn t like you  This is unusual for you   like constantly  It s one of the few methods that breaks people out of a cult  The stars seen by people at the south  bottom of south america  africa  and australia  as they look towards the south pole  See the images in the answer here https   physics stackexchange com a               I don   t believe these people exist  So  if you could have your friend do an AMA I   d appreciate it  I have to assume he   s trolling you    or this is a shitpost  How do they explain the time zones  GPS      I   m not even going to try to ponder this  I   d prefer to stick with I don   t believe these people exist  Ask him to define what specific proof would convince him  You can t  There s plenty of simple experiments that you can do that will prove that the world isn t flat  If they believe that the world is flat in the face of all the easily verifiable evidence then they don t want to believe otherwise and there s nothing you can do to change their mind  If at this point in time you need to have that discussion with your friend  I   d say he is beyond salvation Tell them capitalism would have set up amusement parks at the edge so people can swing off of the edge Ask them why they believe the earth is flat  Shift the burden of proof back onto them  If they start giving arguments against a spherical earth  interrupt them   I asked you why you believe the earth is flat  not why you disagree with a round planet  Why do you believe the earth is flat  Don t argue against anything  argue for your belief   Enjoy the mental gymnastics  can they prove it is flat  if not they need to re evaluate their thinking   I wonder what their explanation is for why Jupiter   s spot    goes off the edge of the map    and then reappears on the other side  Or why almost literally everything in the universe appears round   Send them to space  Or show them live video from ISS   The southern hemisphere sees a different star pattern than the northern hemisphere  In a dome nothing would stop the light from the sun from being visble everywhere on earth  all the time  same goes for the moon  If they bring up planes make sure to let them know that planes fly by keeping a constant altitude    Maybe don t show the video itself bc the person might think it s condescending  but a couple good points  https   m youtube com watch v AQl h Aa  s vl en Other than that  it s difficult to win an argument with an informed person  but it s impossible to win an argument with a stubbornly ignorant person  Good luck   I   ll bet you dollars to donuts they   re trolling you  Lots of people looooove to be contrarian  They get a kick out of watching you try and convince you obvious stuff  Don   t fall for it  Take him to a port on a large body of water to watch ships come and go also try to hear out his explanation of seasons the equator and ask him why toilets flow the opposite direction in Australia ps show him videos of the toilet  The easiest argument is that if the Earth is flat  then people in the Southern Hemisphere would all be looking in a different direction while looking to the south if the Earth was indeed flat  Take two cities that are a few hundred miles apart in the Southern Hemisphere  People in each city both should be looking directly south  How come they can both see the same star constellations  Or physicists  geologists  astronomers  and a bunch of other scientists are all lying  Millions of people are hiding the truth  Or thousands and thousands of people who have PHD s and devoted their lives to the study of their scientific fields are simply wrong while some guys who has zero scientific knowledge or experience suddenly knows more about the way things are   When someone vehemently denies science  there s not a lot you can do besides telling them directly   Moon is a sphere so are other planets  not to mention a star named   Sun    why would earth be flat   Simple flight to another country  curvature of the earth is clearly visible from a plane    Its not that he dosent have evidence  he chooses to throw science away and make his own shit   Stupidity or lack of oxygen to the brain might be the flat culprit          AY Blackie AY Blackie il y a   ans John Savage It s hilarious that for      years it s been known the earth is round yet educated people today refuse to accept this even with rock hard evidence put in front of them  flat earthers you lot are bellends\n"

about      degrees below the zenith  that is only      degrees above the horizon  seen from the southernmost point of south africa  so your question is based on incorrect premises    your second question is simple  frames of reference  the helicopter  just  you d me  the air  d everything else  is moving along with the rotating earth  you don t fly to the back of the ple at     mph when you

because it would be either completely faked or  accompied  by lots of fake info  such as footages produced in a studio prior to the flight  actually  any long distce flight  prove that the earth is not spherical  if it was performed by honest people  but that again would be highly problematic  because if such a flight happened d people  see that the earth is not a globe  those people addicted to science  start to object  claiming that the flight was fake  fact is  nobody c ever prove ything   at least not to those who stick to   infused  world view  regardless if it is the belief about a flat

the curvature of the earth as ships go over the horizon  it s not hard to prove at all     predrag l predrag l  y a   semaines   mikewiththebluecar  so  i have never claimed that the earth wasn t curved  in my opinion the earth is bulged yet not spherical  it looks  a      of a sphere  you know that there is a sphere d a hemisphere  so just go further th that d imagine a sixteenth sphere  besides  have you been at        feet over the oce  i have  d no curvature was observable  but if you refer to        meters over the oce  i don t know what c be observed from there  because i have never been that high  have you  besides  even if the curvature c be observable from such a height  it doesn t disprove my understding  because the earth need not be a full sphere so as to be curved

the oce which wouldn t have y curve at all if the earth was flat because water is self leveling  the reason the oce is curved is because it s being pulled towards the center of the earth  even globebusters made the mistake of admitting that you c t see the bottom of sta barbara isld from beverly hls from  elevation of     feet  they claimed that according to the earth curvature calculator it shouldn t be visible at all then they said  but you c clearly see  the majority  of the isld  if the earth was flat you d be able to see all of it including the beach on the isld but you c t because it s blocked by the curvature of the earth  they also made other mistake when discussing the nat geo video where they were testing the curvature of the earth at the salton lake in california by saying that the boat hadn t reached the horizon yet which they were correct the boat hadn t reached the horizon but on a flat earth looking over water there shouldn t be a horizon in the first place  by admitting that there is a horizon on a lake they already admitted that the horizon does exist thereby confirming that the earth is a sphere d not flat  if the earth was flat you d be able to see the bk on the other side of the lake  this just goes to show that even when flat earthers see the evidence for themselves they stl reject it    mikewiththebluecar mikewiththebluecar  y a

a    on  th december there was a total solar eclipse which was visible only in extreme south locations  particularly antarctica  it was streamed live from the union glacier base near the shores of the weddell sea  which is basically south of south america  on several websites including nasa s   in addition to over    people who travelled there to watch it  two ple loads of eclipse chasers  from western australia d che  on opposite sides of the disc  flew south to get a good view of it from        feet  it was also observed as a partial eclipse from south africa d melbourne   when it was observed in australia it was just before sunset d people looked west to watch it  in contrast  folks in south africa had to look eastwards as it was early morning    but here s the big thing  the people observing it from the union glacier base watched it when it was technically around midnight  at this time of the year the sun doesn t set in antartica  it just goes around in circles about    degrees above the horizon  and to fm the eclipse  the cameras streaming it were pointed south  over the south pole  in the opposite direction to the  centre of the disc    when totality was happening over antarctica  it was around noon in india  the sun would have been at it s highest in the indi sky   how is all of this  happening more or less simultaneously  explainable in the flat earth model  try mapping this out on the flat earth disc   then there is the stunning  eclipse over antarctica  image from the nasa climate satellite  orbiting around a mlion mes from earth  that photographed the totality shadow over the weddell sea  you c clearly see how the global earth model clearly explains this in it s entirety   what  flat earthers say to explain this  all fake  how  why       keyboard

forming us  but that larger being does not have the same advtage to believe in itself  it releases a burden from peoples  lives to believe in the flat earth conspiracy  d other simar ideas  it  unt

yourself  your life as  individual is interpreted entirely differently from that of other  you may give significce to your famy  your friends  your ideals  but other individual may never even have contact with ything from your life  not even having the opportunity to deem it as good or bad  because it truly is that insignifict to them  the choice of what you define to be importt in your life is

considerably throughout a   one nice direct method is to set up a camera pointing out to a sea horizon on a clear   preferably from a good height  then add a spirit level to the view d line it up

effect     most often the reasons to join a conspiracy theory are not the misleading arguments  it s to join a group finding fellas or d the feeling of being significt d not believing that whe facing big problems the government people does do nothing  that said  one obvious fact would be that in a time lapse the stars on the northern hemisphere d the stars on the south hemisphere rotate in different directions  different people on different southern continent  africa  south america  australia  c see the southern cross  a star constellation  at the same time  wouldn t be possible on a plain  also the southern cross cnot be seen from nordern hemisphere  the north star cnot be seen by the southern hemisphere    ask them how gravity works  the typical response from flat earthers is that the disk earth is accelerating upwards at     ms s  in reality  g  the local gravitational field strength  varies by around    due to the fact that the earth is technically  oblate spheroid d differences in rock density in different areas  as far as i m aware  there is no flat earth model that c explain this    the problem with flat earthers is not that they believe the earth is flat  it   s their destructive combination of boredom  mis placed search for meing  pride  d stubbornness  my advice is to model the virtues contrary to those vices  suggest ways of finding meing d community that compete with the flat earthers d show the kind of respect for them as a person that   them feel more comfortable chging their view in light of your arguments    flat earthers seem to  those kind of experiments that are performed by every people d simple enough to be understood without y prior knoweledge so i d show your friend this linked video   d other proof for his axiom  it s the eratosthenes proof with just   sticks d a bike  he  stl claim this video is fake d was posted by a goverment agency to confuse you  this os the problem with your average flat earther  it s the same as descartes d its demiurge  if you assume theres  all powerful entity thats trying to shield the truth from you  the ev demiurge demon for descartes or the goverment for your friend  then y argument against what you believe the truth is  be shutdown automaticaly becuase the all powerfull ev entity has always the upper hd  this types of theories c never be proven right or wrong d thats why we don t consider them scientific  in the end you have to deal with things that you c test d prove    i ve tried this before with a flatearther  their flat earth model looks  a polar map with  impenetrable ice wall  antarctica  forming the circular boundary of the disc  the sun supposedly circles the disc overhead  my argument was to ask them to simply explain how sunsets work since  in their model  there should always be a line of sight to the sun no matter where you are on the disc  i got accused of being closed minded d brainwashed d no opinions were chged  the person i argued with held my other pseudoscientific beliefs besides being a flatearther  so i think the core belief is more  a general distrust of science   my favourite  the moon is upside down in australia   i m not sure a setting sun  convince him the earth isn t flat as they do seem to come up with some odd excuses to combat it  that s unfortunate  as   what s blocking your view when the sun is setting   would be the first thing i d try  with   where is the sun at night   as the next line of attack  but when somebody does not get to a position by logic  you c t get them out of that position by logic   does he believe that the moon d sun are globes  if so  you  say that the earth would be  that   is there someone he trusts who lives at least a few hundred mes to the east or west  have them talk on the phone near sunset d find out that the sun isn t setting at the same time  if that doesn t convince him  nothing    you c t  most of them believe in flat earth for the religious reason that if god did not create flat earth  then hum are just other life form when they just know hum were created by god to be his special snowflakes  ask them if they   ve ever seen  eclipse that isn   t circular  you c t  these people aren t open to being convinced or having their minds chged  their belief isn t rooted in mistaken facts that you c correct  there s nothing you c say d no proof you c offer that they won t dismiss as fake or reason their way out of  everything just gets woven into the conspiracy  you ll just be wasting your time d energy  don t associate with moroons  circumpolar star variation by

psychology there   s a thing called motivated reasoning  where people are motivated to form their opinions based almost completely on their emotions  even when new facts are introduced motivated reasoning  keep  individual from chging their mind because their subjective reality is more importt to them th the objective reality around them  i d the video of the flat earthers that went out on a big lake with a bright light on a boat at night d binoculars on shore to    prove    their theory  they were surprised by the fact the n   t find the light unless they raised it up on the boat  the moon appears upside down in the southern hemisphere  compared to the northern hemisphere  you need to let this friend go  d find other friend  maybe find a friend that isn t so stupid  ask him how he explains sunrise sunset  sun disappearing below the horizon from the bottom  d timezones at the same time you should understd that you don   t need to convince yone  you c only share scientific sources d it   s up to your friend to accept it or not  i don t think he s going to chge his view that nasa lied  i wonder if you c fight conspiracies with more conspiracies  maybe the reason they lied was for something else     i dunno  it was too hard so they all just drk beer d got some interns to  the images  imagine how good of a party you  throw with all that money  yeah that was it  a secret compy wide party with all the booze you c hdle  if they say that every proof you offer is faked  it s going to be hard to do that   ya good luck convincing your friend     as i ve also mentioned here a few times  in the end  this is question for you to pose to ask psychnology rather th ask physics  you c talk about rational  well accepted  rigorously proven  endlessly photographed from space kind of physics with your friend all night long  unt the cows come home in the morning light  but he stl  never ever believe you  thus the fact that all this is about psychology d not physics  this is a also a possibly bad sign about your friend s mental health  unfortunately     note  people who are prone to this kind of obviously bizarre d outldish conspiracy thinking are more susceptible d vulnerable to even more dgerous irrational cult  thinking  they often embrace this strge thinking because inside they believe it s them   special   d   better      that they somehow have profound knoedge that the rest of us don t know because we re all too dim or foolish to see the   greater truth   that they  in their enlightened uprisen intelligence d wisdom see  they walk around seeing themselves as the greater wise ones  when in reality rather th this making them seem special in a positive way in the eyes of others  it instead only s them std out in a glaring repulsive cringe foolish way    yeah i had a friend who fell down that particular rabbit hole  you won t win y debates by throwing facts in their face or telling them they re wrong  ask questions  be earnestly interested d ask them how it works  for example  what s you think the world is flat  how does the flat earth theory work  where did you hear about flat earth  what s you trust those sources  why do you distrust sources that say otherwise  try to avoid giving your own conclusions  leading them  or condescending them in y way  they probably won t leave the conversation saying they ve chged their mind  but you ll sow the seed of doubt in their belief that they may reflect on    i me  you  flip it around d just ask them to show you the edge of our flat earth  or have them explain why does the force of gravity always point straight down  no matter where you are  on a disk  it would pull towards its middle  so the closer you are to the edge  the more it would point sideways  they  of course  won t do that because they don t wt to be reasoned with d the odd excuses are a proof of that    i don t think that y argument  convince them since it s not really a scientific issue  it s a psychological d political issue  if one believes that there is a conspiracy whose goal is to hide truth from the rest of the population  then one cnot trust ybody  any argument that uses stdard science  not be trusted because stdard science  in their opinion  is one way the conspiracy brainwashes us  they  never believe stdard science unless they find the evidence for themselves  they basically would  to rebud science from scratch on their own  the real problem is trusting other people    first have him watch behind the curve on netflix  at the very least he ll pick up some sweet hammer trick skls  my personal favorite would be to send him up in a weather balloon  redbull challenge dude so he c sky dive from the edge of space  if your friend wts to know  there is a really easy way  draw a reaaaaly big trigle on earth  if the gles add up to     degrees  then the earth is flat  if they add up to more th     degrees  then the earth has a curved surface  with some fcy math  it c be shown that it is a sphere  if they add up to less th     degrees  earth is a ly a hyperbolic saddle point  another thing he c do is simple fucking math  go to somewhere flat d pick a tall ass ld mark  get it s height  now walk away in literally y direction unt you c t see it  curvature of earth  horizon   measure the distces d you c come up with a reasonable estimate for the radius of curvature based upon some trigonmetry  he  try setting up a foucault pendulum  get his ass a non stop flight trip that goes most of the way around the world d have him try to figure out how he s experiencing       hrs of  light  he  try firing a bullet with a tracer round parallel to the ground on a clear  with a high powered scope d rifle  after a km or so of flight  the coriolis effect  kick become obvious as the bullet starts to drift to the left or right  depending on the direction you fire it   he  try to explain why sunsets are red  he  do the thing they did on behind curve with a laser  he c try to explain how we don t detect the four elephts stding on the back of a git turtle which supports the flat earth  not to mention the depths below  it s turtles all the way down after that point   there are a mlion ways  your friend doesn t care whether it is or not  he just wts to be accepted d be part of  ingroup  find him a new ingroup   i know youre probably asking for a nice physics y wer  but might i try a different approach  ask ur friend if they would go to   ends edge of the earth  theme park set on the ends of the flat earth  d then ask why they ve never heard of that kind of place existing  don t you think  if the earth really were flat  d that the ends of the earth did exist  we d have heard of some compy making money off of it by now   only half joking tbh maybe it might work   maybe mention some small things  like the e  tv  s effect  where something that s moving east is percieved as lighter th when moving west  this is because of the chge in the objects gular velocity as it travels with the rotating earth   obviusly the mass doesn t chge but the imaginary centrifugal force pointed outwards becomes greater or smaller  and this difference is obviously really small  but it s measurable  i d personally think that small things  this that are measurable if you try hard enough might go a long way as  argument  but i ve never met someone who actually thinks the earth is flat so i don t actually know how well it would work   i might have explained this inaccurately i d recommend you look it up yourself   there are enough proofs  but does he she really wt to know the truth or is he she in denial  helium balloon d a go pro might work  you c even see the curve if you got sea on the horizon  i ve always wted to try a cross country trip where you find the biggest square you c drive  plot the distce you drove on a ple d the beginning d end points of the journey should not match up  and on a mercator projection  it should be distorted d not look  a square ymore  some cars even have a but in compass to go along with the odometer to help you track it without using gps which  be explained away as government controlled  what i really wt to do is write some arduino code to log it all for me to increase accuracy since no roads are going to be perfectly straight for the journey  get a digital compass or accelerometer module to register direction d either a radar or tachometer module to register speed  plot the course d log it to  sd card  you should be able to dump it into excel d graph it fairly easy  you get a vacation together  you get to see some sights  d you should frame it as you don t know how it  turn out  that you re in it to find out together  if you get in a car for   weeks together d they know you re only doing it to prove them wrong  that s gonna be  awkward vacation i bet  i don t know where you are  but the us has some big  wide open spaces to try this  don   t bother  the evidence is out there it is just they don   t wt to look at it  lost cause  either just let it go or stop associating with unreasonable people  if you have a drone you c send it up just after sunset d stl be able to see the sun  d olson s in search of a flat earth on youtube might help you  same with beyond the curve on netflix  neither are short though  good luck the most convincing way is with the star rotation  but you would need someone in the other hemisphere  they are seen as opposite rotations d is not possible to explain with y flat earth theory send him this link  folding ideas  in search of a flat earth does a good job easy  ask them to explain a foucault pendulum on a flat earth that doesnt rotate  smash his head into a wall maybe that  fix it don   t waste your time on this sort of person  they   ve already made up their mind  you won   t be able to chge it watch the sun set  then go to a higher place d watch ir set again is that friend slot fungible  ask him what he thinks astronomers  physicists  astrophysicists  aero astrospace engineers  etc   actually do  what are they being paid for  what are they researching  is every one of these people lying about their job d their research  how have none of these people ever come out with the    truth    about the earth actually being flat d that mlions of jobs are coverups  that   s because there haven   t been  now who has the proof now  he c   t argue around this one without defying his own logic  this isn   t dealing with physical evidence  it is dealing with probabity d reason  if he c   t see this  then ask him if he has done y of his own research to prove that the earth is flat  or has he just listened to others say it is  again  if he hasn   t done y research  if he defies this  he is defying his own logic  therapy   here s a few quick d easy ones  blow a big soap bubble for them d show them how it s round d not flat  this is the same mechic that s the earth round  a sphere is the natural shape to hold the most volume in the least amount of space  it works for soap bubbles  it works for plets  ask them how the  night cycle would even be possible on a flat disc  point out the fact that a single light source   a hging lightbulb  lights up  entire room  not just a cone shape of light  flat earthers  to think that the sun is super small d super close  but that doesn t disprove  night cycles since the disc would stl be lit up      of the time regardless if the earth was flat  you c t have some sections lit up  d some sections in darkness with a flat disc  gravity would be drastically different at the edges of the disc th it would be closer to the center  people at the center would experience much higher gravity  we do not observe that at all how are we able to see different constations in the night sky in different hemispheres if the earth was flat  if it was flat  then we would all see the same constations everywhere at the same time  c t exactly look behind the disc we are stding on    as there is a big disc in the way   don   t even try   they sound really stupid     friend      honestly  it   s probably not worth your time  depending on his age  i hate seeing science chnels on youtube consttly debating flat earthers who are grown adults  it   s a waste of time  d honestly  it   s upsetting  they should use their platform to teach people with  open mind science   not debate people who  never chge their mind  the net utity is basically zero debating those dunces  whereas producing educational videos may educate thousds upon thousds of people   don t  get better friends   you know how the earth is luminated right  depending on the season  north or south might get more less sunlight  but we c just take the winter scenario to  our point more obvious  on a globe earth model  it s perfect sense for it to be bright where it s bright d dark where it s dark because it s common sense d we c observe it with y round object under a light source  try drawing the dark d bright zones on a flat earth model  now i don t know if he might have the mental capacity to imagine how it would look   but if you draw it you would get a map where it s dark in the very centre  the north pole  whe almost the entirety of the edges are bright  south pole  no stretch of imagination or mental gymnastics that i have seen c  this seem plausible in y way  if he has y open mindedness or at least enough intelligence to understd why that drawing is the way it is  you might covert him  alternatively  he ll just accuse you of lying if he doesn t understd basic logic  rather probable  or just  something up dodge the topic if he realizes the fragity of his claim d start clinging to other points whe disregarding a massive problem with his model   one of the best things you c do is remind them  this isn t  you  this is unusual for you    consttly  it s one of the few methods that breaks people out of a cult  the stars seen by people at the south  bottom of south america  africa  d australia  as they look towards the south pole  see the images in the wer here https   physics stackexchge com a               i don   t believe these people exist  so  if you  have your friend do  ama i   d appreciate it  i have to assume he   s trolling you    or this is a shitpost  how do they explain the time zones  gps      i   m not even going to try to ponder this  i   d prefer to stick with i don   t believe these people exist  ask him to define what specific proof would convince him  you c t  there s plenty of simple experiments that you c do that  prove that the world isn t flat  if they believe that the world is flat in the face of all the easy verifiable evidence then they don t wt to believe otherwise d there s nothing you c do to chge their mind  if at this point in time you need to have that discussion with your friend  i   d say he is beyond salvation tell them capitalism would have set up amusement parks at the edge so people c swing off of the edge ask them why they believe the earth is flat  shift the burden of proof back onto them  if they start giving arguments against a spherical earth  interrupt them   i asked you why you believe the earth is flat  not why you disagree with a round plet  why do you believe the earth is flat  don t argue against ything  argue for your belief   enjoy the mental gymnastics  c they prove it is flat  if not they need to re evaluate their thinking   i wonder what their explation is for why jupiter   s spot    goes off the edge of the map    d then reappears on the other side  or why almost literally everything in the universe appears round   send them to space  or show them live video from iss   the southern hemisphere sees a different star pattern th the northern hemisphere  in a dome nothing would stop the light from the sun from being visble everywhere on earth  all the time  same goes for the moon  if they bring up ples  sure to let them know that ples fly by keeping a constt altitude    maybe don t show the video itself bc the person might think it s condescending  but a couple good points  https   m youtube com watch v aql h aa  s vl en other th that  it s difficult to win  argument with  informed person  but it s impossible to win  argument with a stubbornly ignort person  good luck   i   ll bet you dollars to donuts they   re trolling you  lots of people looooove to be contrari  they get a kick out of watching you try d convince you obvious stuff  don   t fall for it  take him to a port on a large body of water to watch ships come d go also try to hear out his explation of seasons the equator d ask him why toets flow the opposite direction in australia ps show him videos of the toet  the easiest argument is that if the earth is flat  then people in the southern hemisphere would all be looking in a different direction whe looking to the south if the earth was indeed flat  take two cities that are a few hundred mes apart in the southern hemisphere  people in each city both should be looking directly south  how come they c both see the same star constellations  or physicists  geologists  astronomers  d a bunch of other scientists are all lying  mlions of people are hiding the truth  or thousds d thousds of people who have phd s d devoted their lives to the study of their scientific fields are simply wrong whe some guys who has zero scientific knoedge or experience suddenly knows more about the way things are   when someone vehemently denies science  there s not a lot you c do besides telling them directly   moon is a sphere so are other plets  not to mention a star named   sun    why would earth be flat   simple flight to other country  curvature of the earth is clearly visible from a ple    its not that he dosent have evidence  he chooses to throw science away d  his own shit   stupidity or lack of oxygen to the brain might be the flat culprit          ay blackie ay blackie  y a    john savage it s harious that for      years it s been known the earth is round yet educated people to refuse to accept this even with rock hard evidence put in front of them  flat earthers you lot are bellends\n"

the shadow  as the legs of a trigle  he calculated the gle of the sun s rays      this turned out to be about     or     th the circumference of a circle  taking the earth as spherical  d knowing both

i see clearly that you are a victim of dogma     mikewiththebluecar mikewiththebluecar  y a   semaines   smooth drops  actually it does prove the shape of the earth especially when your flying over the oce because you c see the curvature of the earth from        feet     predrag l predrag l  y a   semaines   mikewiththebluecar  ironically  even flying from pole to pole wouldn t do the job  because it would be either completely faked or  accompied  by lots of fake info  such as footages produced in a studio prior to the flight  actually  any long distce flight  prove that the earth is not spherical  if it was performed by honest people  but that again would be highly problematic  because if such a flight happened d people  see that the earth is not a globe  those people addicted to science  start to object  claiming that the flight was fake  fact is  nobody c ever prove ything   at least not to those who stick to   infused  world view  regardless if it is the belief about a flat earth or the belief about a globe     mikewiththebluecar mikewiththebluecar  y a   semaines   predrag l  you c see the curvature of the earth when your flying at        feet over the oce  you c see the curvature of the earth as ships go over the horizon  it s not hard to prove at all     predrag l predrag l  y a   semaines   mikewiththebluecar  so  i have never claimed that the earth wasn t curved  in my opinion the earth is bulged yet not spherical  it looks  a      of a sphere  you know that there is a sphere d a hemisphere  so just go further th that d imagine a sixteenth sphere  besides  have you been at        feet over the oce  i have  d no curvature was observable  but if you refer to        meters over the oce  i don t know what c be observed from there  because i have never been that high  have you  besides  even if the curvature c be observable from such a height  it doesn t disprove my understding  because the earth need not be a full sphere so as to be curved        mikewiththebluecar mikewiththebluecar  y a   semaines   predrag l  i have been        feet above the oce before several times flying to   from hawaii d the phippines d i  definitely see a curve in the oce which wouldn t have y curve at all if the earth was flat because water is self leveling  the reason the oce is curved is because it s being pulled towards the center of the earth  even globebusters made the mistake of admitting that you c t see the bottom of sta barbara isld from beverly hls from  elevation of     feet  they claimed that according to the earth curvature calculator it shouldn t be visible at all then they said  but you c clearly see  the majority  of the isld  if the earth was flat you d be able to see all of it including the beach on the isld but you c t because it s blocked by the curvature of the earth  they also made other mistake when discussing the nat geo video where they were testing the curvature of the earth at the salton lake in california by saying that the boat hadn t reached the horizon yet which they were correct the boat hadn t reached the horizon but on a flat earth looking over water there shouldn t be a horizon in the first place  by admitting that there is a horizon on a lake they already admitted that the horizon does exist thereby confirming that the earth is a sphere d not flat  if the earth was flat you d be able to see the bk on the other side of the lake  this just goes to show that even when flat earthers see the evidence for themselves they stl reject it    mikewiththebluecar mikewiththebluecar  y a

a    on  th december there was a total solar eclipse which was visible only in extreme south locations  particularly antarctica  it was streamed live from the union glacier base near the shores of the weddell sea  which is basically south of south america  on several websites including nasa s   in addition to over    people who travelled there to watch it  two ple loads of eclipse chasers  from western australia d che  on opposite sides of the disc  flew south to get a good view of it from        feet  it was also observed as a partial eclipse from south africa d melbourne   when it was observed in australia it was just before sunset d people looked west to watch it  in contrast  folks in south africa had to look eastwards as it was early morning    but here s the big thing  the people observing it from the union glacier base watched it when it was technically around midnight  at this time of the year the sun doesn t set in antartica  it just goes around in circles about    degrees above the horizon  and to fm the eclipse  the cameras streaming it were pointed south  over the south pole  in the opposite direction to the  centre of the disc    when totality was happening over antarctica  it was around noon in india  the sun would have been at it s highest in the indi sky   how is all of this  happening more or less simultaneously  explainable in the flat earth model  try mapping this out on the flat earth disc   then there is the stunning  eclipse over antarctica  image from the nasa climate satellite  orbiting around a mlion mes from earth  that photographed the totality shadow over the weddell sea  you c clearly see how the global earth model clearly explains this in it s entirety   what  flat earthers say to explain this  all fake  how  why       keyboard

for them  they  have to go live just  the rest of the population that funds them  funding here is  keyword  i me the wers are there  you just have to puzzle it together to get to the really core of it   even mark s  says something to this effect when he says those who benefit from this the most are those high level people that control the economies of the world  but then again those are the ones who also have the most to loose if things take a different route  a more honest approach    well i think a lot of flat earthers are doing exactly that  observing with all their senses d finding the

and they ll keep coming up with odder d odder excuses  even ones that are patently ridiculous  rather th give up this idea that s them feel  they re special because they know   the truth    the best you c do  i think  is to get a lot of deta about what he believes d try to find a contradiction in it  like  my of them believe the sun is a small  close globe that circles around d shines down  a spotlight  two easy verifiable contradictions of this are a  the sun sets  d b  it never chges its apparent size in the sky  even though  according to the flat earth model  its distce varies considerably throughout a   one nice direct method is to set up a camera pointing out to a sea horizon on a clear   preferably from a good height  then add a spirit level to the view d line it up against the horizon  if you take a photo d then horizontally  but not vertically  compress the image  the curvature is pretty easy to see against the straight spirit level  this rules out y in camera effect     most often the reasons to join a conspiracy theory are not the misleading arguments  it s to join a group finding fellas or d the feeling of being significt d not believing that whe facing big problems the government people does do nothing  that said  one obvious fact would be that in a time lapse the stars on the northern hemisphere d the stars on the south hemisphere rotate in different directions  different people on different southern continent  africa  south america  australia  c see the southern cross  a star constellation  at the same time  wouldn t be possible on a plain  also the southern cross cnot be seen from nordern hemisphere  the north star cnot be seen by the southern hemisphere    ask them how gravity works  the typical response from flat earthers is that the disk earth is accelerating upwards at     ms s  in reality  g  the local gravitational field strength  varies by around    due to the fact that the earth is technically  oblate spheroid d differences in rock density in different areas  as far as i m aware  there is no flat earth model that c explain this    the problem with flat earthers is not that they believe the earth is flat  it   s their destructive combination of boredom  mis placed search for meing  pride  d stubbornness  my advice is to model the virtues contrary to those vices  suggest ways of finding meing d community that compete with the flat earthers d show the kind of respect for them as a person that   them feel more comfortable chging their view in light of your arguments    flat earthers seem to  those kind of experiments that are performed by every people d simple enough to be understood without y prior knoweledge so i d show your friend this linked video   d other proof for his axiom  it s the eratosthenes proof with just   sticks d a bike  he  stl claim this video is fake d was posted by a goverment agency to confuse you  this os the problem with your average flat earther  it s the same as descartes d its demiurge  if you assume theres  all powerful entity thats trying to shield the truth from you  the ev demiurge demon for descartes or the goverment for your friend  then y argument against what you believe the truth is  be shutdown automaticaly becuase the all powerfull ev entity has always the upper hd  this types of theories c never be proven right or wrong d thats why we don t consider them scientific  in the end you have to deal with things that you c test d prove    i ve tried this before with a flatearther  their flat earth model looks  a polar map with  impenetrable ice wall  antarctica  forming the circular boundary of the disc  the sun supposedly circles the disc overhead  my argument was to ask them to simply explain how sunsets work since  in their model  there should always be a line of sight to the sun no matter where you are on the disc  i got accused of being closed minded d brainwashed d no opinions were chged  the person i argued with held my other pseudoscientific beliefs besides being a flatearther  so i think the core belief is more  a general distrust of science   my favourite  the moon is upside down in australia   i m not sure a setting sun  convince him the earth isn t flat as they do seem to come up with some odd excuses to combat it  that s unfortunate  as   what s blocking your view when the sun is setting   would be the first thing i d try  with   where is the sun at night   as the next line of attack  but when somebody does not get to a position by logic  you c t get them out of that position by logic   does he believe that the moon d sun are globes  if so  you  say that the earth would be  that   is there someone he trusts who lives at least a few hundred mes to the east or west  have them talk on the phone near sunset d find out that the sun isn t setting at the same time  if that doesn t convince him  nothing    you c t  most of them believe in flat earth for the religious reason that if god did not create flat earth  then hum are just other life form when they just know hum were created by god to be his special snowflakes  ask them if they   ve ever seen  eclipse that isn   t circular  you c t  these people aren t open to being convinced or having their minds chged  their belief isn t rooted in mistaken facts that you c correct  there s nothing you c say d no proof you c offer that they won t dismiss as fake or reason their way out of  everything just gets woven into the conspiracy  you ll just be wasting your time d energy  don t associate with moroons  circumpolar star variation by

night lengths for different latitudes the sun sets   why do you care  he s either messing with you or too far gone  find people who wt to enjoy real life d go put your energy into being with them   in psychology there   s a thing called motivated reasoning  where people are motivated to form their opinions based almost completely on their emotions  even when new facts are introduced motivated reasoning  keep  individual from chging their mind because their subjective reality is more importt to them th the objective reality around them  i d the video of the flat earthers that went out on a big lake with a bright light on a boat at night d binoculars on shore to    prove    their theory  they were surprised by the fact the n   t find the light unless they raised it up on the boat  the moon appears upside down in the southern hemisphere  compared to the northern hemisphere  you need to let this friend go  d find other friend  maybe find a friend that isn t so stupid  ask him how he explains sunrise sunset  sun disappearing below the horizon from the bottom  d timezones at the same time you should understd that you don   t need to convince yone  you c only share scientific sources d it   s up to your friend to accept it or not  i don t think he s going to chge his view that nasa lied  i wonder if you c fight conspiracies with more conspiracies  maybe the reason they lied was for something else     i dunno  it was too hard so they all just drk beer d got some interns to  the images  imagine how good of a party you  throw with all that money  yeah that was it  a secret compy wide party with all the booze you c hdle  if they say that every proof you offer is faked  it s going to be hard to do that   ya good luck convincing your friend     as i ve also mentioned here a few times  in the end  this is question for you to pose to ask psychnology rather th ask physics  you c talk about rational  well accepted  rigorously proven  endlessly photographed from space kind of physics with your friend all night long  unt the cows come home in the morning light  but he stl  never ever believe you  thus the fact that all this is about psychology d not physics  this is a also a possibly bad sign about your friend s mental health  unfortunately     note  people who are prone to this kind of obviously bizarre d outldish conspiracy thinking are more susceptible d vulnerable to even more dgerous irrational cult  thinking  they often embrace this strge thinking because inside they believe it s them   special   d   better      that they somehow have profound knoedge that the rest of us don t know because we re all too dim or foolish to see the   greater truth   that they  in their enlightened uprisen intelligence d wisdom see  they walk around seeing themselves as the greater wise ones  when in reality rather th this making them seem special in a positive way in the eyes of others  it instead only s them std out in a glaring repulsive cringe foolish way    yeah i had a friend who fell down that particular rabbit hole  you won t win y debates by throwing facts in their face or telling them they re wrong  ask questions  be earnestly interested d ask them how it works  for example  what s you think the world is flat  how does the flat earth theory work  where did you hear about flat earth  what s you trust those sources  why do you distrust sources that say otherwise  try to avoid giving your own conclusions  leading them  or condescending them in y way  they probably won t leave the conversation saying they ve chged their mind  but you ll sow the seed of doubt in their belief that they may reflect on    i me  you  flip it around d just ask them to show you the edge of our flat earth  or have them explain why does the force of gravity always point straight down  no matter where you are  on a disk  it would pull towards its middle  so the closer you are to the edge  the more it would point sideways  they  of course  won t do that because they don t wt to be reasoned with d the odd excuses are a proof of that    i don t think that y argument  convince them since it s not really a scientific issue  it s a psychological d political issue  if one believes that there is a conspiracy whose goal is to hide truth from the rest of the population  then one cnot trust ybody  any argument that uses stdard science  not be trusted because stdard science  in their opinion  is one way the conspiracy brainwashes us  they  never believe stdard science unless they find the evidence for themselves  they basically would  to rebud science from scratch on their own  the real problem is trusting other people    first have him watch behind the curve on netflix  at the very least he ll pick up some sweet hammer trick skls  my personal favorite would be to send him up in a weather balloon  redbull challenge dude so he c sky dive from the edge of space  if your friend wts to know  there is a really easy way  draw a reaaaaly big trigle on earth  if the gles add up to     degrees  then the earth is flat  if they add up to more th     degrees  then the earth has a curved surface  with some fcy math  it c be shown that it is a sphere  if they add up to less th     degrees  earth is a ly a hyperbolic saddle point  another thing he c do is simple fucking math  go to somewhere flat d pick a tall ass ld mark  get it s height  now walk away in literally y direction unt you c t see it  curvature of earth  horizon   measure the distces d you c come up with a reasonable estimate for the radius of curvature based upon some trigonmetry  he  try setting up a foucault pendulum  get his ass a non stop flight trip that goes most of the way around the world d have him try to figure out how he s experiencing       hrs of  light  he  try firing a bullet with a tracer round parallel to the ground on a clear  with a high powered scope d rifle  after a km or so of flight  the coriolis effect  kick become obvious as the bullet starts to drift to the left or right  depending on the direction you fire it   he  try to explain why sunsets are red  he  do the thing they did on behind curve with a laser  he c try to explain how we don t detect the four elephts stding on the back of a git turtle which supports the flat earth  not to mention the depths below  it s turtles all the way down after that point   there are a mlion ways  your friend doesn t care whether it is or not  he just wts to be accepted d be part of  ingroup  find him a new ingroup   i know youre probably asking for a nice physics y wer  but might i try a different approach  ask ur friend if they would go to   ends edge of the earth  theme park set on the ends of the flat earth  d then ask why they ve never heard of that kind of place existing  don t you think  if the earth really were flat  d that the ends of the earth did exist  we d have heard of some compy making money off of it by now   only half joking tbh maybe it might work   maybe mention some small things  like the e  tv  s effect  where something that s moving east is percieved as lighter th when moving west  this is because of the chge in the objects gular velocity as it travels with the rotating earth   obviusly the mass doesn t chge but the imaginary centrifugal force pointed outwards becomes greater or smaller  and this difference is obviously really small  but it s measurable  i d personally think that small things  this that are measurable if you try hard enough might go a long way as  argument  but i ve never met someone who actually thinks the earth is flat so i don t actually know how well it would work   i might have explained this inaccurately i d recommend you look it up yourself   there are enough proofs  but does he she really wt to know the truth or is he she in denial  helium balloon d a go pro might work  you c even see the curve if you got sea on the horizon  i ve always wted to try a cross country trip where you find the biggest square you c drive  plot the distce you drove on a ple d the beginning d end points of the journey should not match up  and on a mercator projection  it should be distorted d not look  a square ymore  some cars even have a but in compass to go along with the odometer to help you track it without using gps which  be explained away as government controlled  what i really wt to do is write some arduino code to log it all for me to increase accuracy since no roads are going to be perfectly straight for the journey  get a digital compass or accelerometer module to register direction d either a radar or tachometer module to register speed  plot the course d log it to  sd card  you should be able to dump it into excel d graph it fairly easy  you get a vacation together  you get to see some sights  d you should frame it as you don t know how it  turn out  that you re in it to find out together  if you get in a car for   weeks together d they know you re only doing it to prove them wrong  that s gonna be  awkward vacation i bet  i don t know where you are  but the us has some big  wide open spaces to try this  don   t bother  the evidence is out there it is just they don   t wt to look at it  lost cause  either just let it go or stop associating with unreasonable people  if you have a drone you c send it up just after sunset d stl be able to see the sun  d olson s in search of a flat earth on youtube might help you  same with beyond the curve on netflix  neither are short though  good luck the most convincing way is with the star rotation  but you would need someone in the other hemisphere  they are seen as opposite rotations d is not possible to explain with y flat earth theory send him this link  folding ideas  in search of a flat earth does a good job easy  ask them to explain a foucault pendulum on a flat earth that doesnt rotate  smash his head into a wall maybe that  fix it don   t waste your time on this sort of person  they   ve already made up their mind  you won   t be able to chge it watch the sun set  then go to a higher place d watch ir set again is that friend slot fungible  ask him what he thinks astronomers  physicists  astrophysicists  aero astrospace engineers  etc   actually do  what are they being paid for  what are they researching  is every one of these people lying about their job d their research  how have none of these people ever come out with the    truth    about the earth actually being flat d that mlions of jobs are coverups  that   s because there haven   t been  now who has the proof now  he c   t argue around this one without defying his own logic  this isn   t dealing with physical evidence  it is dealing with probabity d reason  if he c   t see this  then ask him if he has done y of his own research to prove that the earth is flat  or has he just listened to others say it is  again  if he hasn   t done y research  if he defies this  he is defying his own logic  therapy   here s a few quick d easy ones  blow a big soap bubble for them d show them how it s round d not flat  this is the same mechic that s the earth round  a sphere is the natural shape to hold the most volume in the least amount of space  it works for soap bubbles  it works for plets  ask them how the  night cycle would even be possible on a flat disc  point out the fact that a single light source   a hging lightbulb  lights up  entire room  not just a cone shape of light  flat earthers  to think that the sun is super small d super close  but that doesn t disprove  night cycles since the disc would stl be lit up      of the time regardless if the earth was flat  you c t have some sections lit up  d some sections in darkness with a flat disc  gravity would be drastically different at the edges of the disc th it would be closer to the center  people at the center would experience much higher gravity  we do not observe that at all how are we able to see different constations in the night sky in different hemispheres if the earth was flat  if it was flat  then we would all see the same constations everywhere at the same time  c t exactly look behind the disc we are stding on    as there is a big disc in the way   don   t even try   they sound really stupid     friend      honestly  it   s probably not worth your time  depending on his age  i hate seeing science chnels on youtube consttly debating flat earthers who are grown adults  it   s a waste of time  d honestly  it   s upsetting  they should use their platform to teach people with  open mind science   not debate people who  never chge their mind  the net utity is basically zero debating those dunces  whereas producing educational videos may educate thousds upon thousds of people   don t  get better friends   you know how the earth is luminated right  depending on the season  north or south might get more less sunlight  but we c just take the winter scenario to  our point more obvious  on a globe earth model  it s perfect sense for it to be bright where it s bright d dark where it s dark because it s common sense d we c observe it with y round object under a light source  try drawing the dark d bright zones on a flat earth model  now i don t know if he might have the mental capacity to imagine how it would look   but if you draw it you would get a map where it s dark in the very centre  the north pole  whe almost the entirety of the edges are bright  south pole  no stretch of imagination or mental gymnastics that i have seen c  this seem plausible in y way  if he has y open mindedness or at least enough intelligence to understd why that drawing is the way it is  you might covert him  alternatively  he ll just accuse you of lying if he doesn t understd basic logic  rather probable  or just  something up dodge the topic if he realizes the fragity of his claim d start clinging to other points whe disregarding a massive problem with his model   one of the best things you c do is remind them  this isn t  you  this is unusual for you    consttly  it s one of the few methods that breaks people out of a cult  the stars seen by people at the south  bottom of south america  africa  d australia  as they look towards the south pole  see the images in the wer here https   physics stackexchge com a               i don   t believe these people exist  so  if you  have your friend do  ama i   d appreciate it  i have to assume he   s trolling you    or this is a shitpost  how do they explain the time zones  gps      i   m not even going to try to ponder this  i   d prefer to stick with i don   t believe these people exist  ask him to define what specific proof would convince him  you c t  there s plenty of simple experiments that you c do that  prove that the world isn t flat  if they believe that the world is flat in the face of all the easy verifiable evidence then they don t wt to believe otherwise d there s nothing you c do to chge their mind  if at this point in time you need to have that discussion with your friend  i   d say he is beyond salvation tell them capitalism would have set up amusement parks at the edge so people c swing off of the edge ask them why they believe the earth is flat  shift the burden of proof back onto them  if they start giving arguments against a spherical earth  interrupt them   i asked you why you believe the earth is flat  not why you disagree with a round plet  why do you believe the earth is flat  don t argue against ything  argue for your belief   enjoy the mental gymnastics  c they prove it is flat  if not they need to re evaluate their thinking   i wonder what their explation is for why jupiter   s spot    goes off the edge of the map    d then reappears on the other side  or why almost literally everything in the universe appears round   send them to space  or show them live video from iss   the southern hemisphere sees a different star pattern th the northern hemisphere  in a dome nothing would stop the light from the sun from being visble everywhere on earth  all the time  same goes for the moon  if they bring up ples  sure to let them know that ples fly by keeping a constt altitude    maybe don t show the video itself bc the person might think it s condescending  but a couple good points  https   m youtube com watch v aql h aa  s vl en other th that  it s difficult to win  argument with  informed person  but it s impossible to win  argument with a stubbornly ignort person  good luck   i   ll bet you dollars to donuts they   re trolling you  lots of people looooove to be contrari  they get a kick out of watching you try d convince you obvious stuff  don   t fall for it  take him to a port on a large body of water to watch ships come d go also try to hear out his explation of seasons the equator d ask him why toets flow the opposite direction in australia ps show him videos of the toet  the easiest argument is that if the earth is flat  then people in the southern hemisphere would all be looking in a different direction whe looking to the south if the earth was indeed flat  take two cities that are a few hundred mes apart in the southern hemisphere  people in each city both should be looking directly south  how come they c both see the same star constellations  or physicists  geologists  astronomers  d a bunch of other scientists are all lying  mlions of people are hiding the truth  or thousds d thousds of people who have phd s d devoted their lives to the study of their scientific fields are simply wrong whe some guys who has zero scientific knoedge or experience suddenly knows more about the way things are   when someone vehemently denies science  there s not a lot you c do besides telling them directly   moon is a sphere so are other plets  not to mention a star named   sun    why would earth be flat   simple flight to other country  curvature of the earth is clearly visible from a ple    its not that he dosent have evidence  he chooses to throw science away d  his own shit   stupidity or lack of oxygen to the brain might be the flat culprit          ay blackie ay blackie  y a    john savage it s harious that for      years it s been known the earth is round yet educated people to refuse to accept this even with rock hard evidence put in front of them  flat earthers you lot are bellends\n"

summer solstice in syene modern asw egypt the sun was directly overhead syene is at latitude north near to the tropic of ccer which was north in bc he knew this because the shadow of someone looking down a deep well at that time in syene blocked the reflection of the sun on the water he then measured the sun s gle of elevation at noon in alexdria by using a vertical rod known as a gnomon d measuring the length of its shadow on the ground using the length of the rod d the length of the shadow as the legs of a trigle he calculated the gle of the sun s rays this turned out to be about or th the circumference of a circle taking the earth as spherical d knowing both the distce d direction of syene he concluded that the earth s circumference was fifty times that distce jez za jez za y a

seen from lizard point at the same time the sun be about degrees below the zenith that is only degrees above the horizon seen from the southernmost point of south africa so your question is based on incorrect premises your second question is simple frames of reference the helicopter just you d me the air d everything else is moving along with the rotating earth you don t fly to the back of the

the world believing it was flat those years during which some saors believed the earth was a globe are nothing saing across the world is absolutely possible on y shape of the earth sextts are not dependent on a spherical earth for if they were they wouldn t have been invented by people who believed the earth was flat a sextt considers the polaris d it works whether people believe it s a star or just a light in the firmament a sextt c determine the longitude regardless if people place it onto a flat earth or a globe earth map because longitude is longitude on both maps if you start your saing on a boat you get from europe to america regardless whether you believe you re saing on a flat earth or on a globe because it s no difference if it made a difference cient people would have

would be a pointless effort smooth drops smooth drops y a semaines modifi mikewiththebluecar being on a ple won t prove the shape of the earth if you have y knoedge at all also the fact that someone

flying over the oce because you c see the curvature of the earth from feet predrag l predrag l y a semaines mikewiththebluecar ironically even flying from pole to pole wouldn t do the job because it would be either completely faked or accompied by lots of fake info such as footages produced in a studio prior to the flight actually any long distce flight prove that the earth is not spherical if it was performed by honest people but that again would be highly problematic because if such a flight happened d people see that the earth is not a globe those people addicted to science start to object claiming that the flight was fake fact is nobody c ever prove ything at least not to those who stick to infused world view regardless if it is the belief about a flat earth or the belief about a globe mikewiththebluecar mikewiththebluecar y a semaines predrag l you c see the curvature of the earth when your flying at feet over the oce you c see the curvature of the earth as ships go over the

looks a of a sphere you know that there is a sphere d a hemisphere so just go further th that d imagine a sixteenth sphere besides have you been at feet over the oce i have d no curvature was observable but if you refer to meters over the oce i don t know what c be observed from there because i have never been that high have you besides even if the curvature c be observable from such a height it doesn t disprove my understding because the earth need not be a full sphere so as to be curved mikewiththebluecar mikewiththebluecar y a semaines predrag l i have been feet above the oce before several times flying to from hawaii d the phippines d i definitely see a curve in the oce which wouldn t have y curve at all if the earth was flat because water is self leveling the reason the oce is curved is because it s being pulled towards the center of the earth even globebusters made the mistake of admitting that you c t see the bottom of sta barbara isld from beverly hls from elevation of feet they claimed that according to the earth curvature calculator it shouldn t be visible at all then they said but you c clearly see the majority of the isld if the earth was flat you d be able to see all of it including the beach on the isld but you c t because it s blocked by the curvature of the earth they also made other mistake when discussing the nat geo video where they were testing the curvature of the earth at the salton lake in california by saying that the boat hadn t reached the horizon yet which they were correct the boat hadn t reached the horizon but on a flat earth looking over water there shouldn t be a horizon in the first place by admitting that there is a horizon on a lake they already admitted that the horizon does exist thereby confirming that the earth is a sphere d not flat if the earth was flat you d be able to see the bk on the other side of the lake this just goes to show that even when flat earthers see the evidence for themselves they stl reject it mikewiththebluecar mikewiththebluecar y a semaines predrag l why would water bulge on a flat earth sure there would be waves but not a bugle big enough to see from over mes away which is

including nasa s in addition to over people who travelled there to watch it two ple loads of eclipse chasers from western australia d che on opposite sides of the disc flew south to get a good view of it from feet it was also observed as a partial eclipse from south africa d melbourne when it was observed in australia it was just before sunset d people looked west to watch it in contrast folks in south africa had to look eastwards as it was early morning but here s the big thing the people observing it from the union glacier base watched it when it was technically around midnight at this time of the year the sun doesn t set in antartica it just goes around in circles about degrees above the horizon and to fm the eclipse the cameras streaming it were pointed south over the south pole in the opposite direction to the centre of the disc when totality was happening over antarctica it was around noon in india the sun would have been at it s highest in the indi sky how is all of this happening more or less simultaneously explainable in the flat earth model try mapping this out on the flat earth disc then there is the stunning eclipse over antarctica image from the nasa climate

whatever beings that lay beyond the flat earth come into existence what are their laws of physics then if they do not live in a mufactured environment as we apparently do if the beings outside of the flat earth dome are born in whatever natural way the outer universe sees fit then what gives them the significce that we are searching for then the question is if insignifict natural rdomly formed creator created us doesn t that us even less significt those who believe in the flat earth claim significce by something larger forming us but that larger being does not have the same advtage to

funding stops to the rich powerful orgizations then i guess it is rather dgerous for them they have to go live just the rest of the population that funds them funding here is keyword i me the wers are there you just have to puzzle it together to get to the really core of it even mark s says something to this effect when he says those who benefit from this the most are those high level people that

without the jargon d mumbo jumbo science offers a lot to the prosperity of the hum race when done honestly d ethically but it also harms society when knowingly gives people false lusion of a world

some odd excuses to combat it and they ll keep coming up with odder d odder excuses even ones that are patently ridiculous rather th give up this idea that s them feel they re special because they know the truth the best you c do i think is to get a lot of deta about what he believes d try to find a contradiction in it like my of them believe the sun is a small close globe that circles around d shines down a spotlight two easy verifiable contradictions of this are a the sun sets d b it never chges its apparent size in the sky even though according to the flat earth model its distce varies considerably throughout a one nice direct method is to set up a camera pointing out to a sea horizon on a clear preferably from a good height then add a spirit level to the view d line it up against the horizon if you take a photo d then horizontally but not vertically compress the image the curvature is pretty easy to see against the straight spirit level this rules out y in camera effect most often the reasons to join a conspiracy theory are not the misleading arguments it s to join a group finding fellas or d the feeling of being significt d not believing that whe facing big problems the government people does do nothing that said one obvious fact would be that in a time lapse the stars on the northern hemisphere d the stars on the south hemisphere rotate in different directions different people on different southern continent africa south america australia c see the southern cross a star constellation at the same time wouldn t be possible on a plain also the southern cross cnot be seen from nordern hemisphere the north star cnot be seen by the southern hemisphere ask them how gravity works the typical response from flat earthers is that the disk earth is accelerating upwards at ms s in reality g the local gravitational field strength varies by around due to the fact that the earth is technically oblate spheroid d differences in rock density in different areas as far as i m aware there is no flat earth model that c explain this the problem with flat earthers is not that they believe the earth is flat it s their destructive combination of boredom mis placed search for meing pride d stubbornness my advice is to model the virtues contrary to those vices suggest ways of finding meing d community that compete with the flat earthers d show the kind of respect for them as a person that them feel more comfortable chging their view in light of your arguments flat earthers seem to those kind of experiments that are performed by every people d simple enough to be understood without y prior knoweledge so i d show your friend this linked video d other proof for his axiom it s the eratosthenes proof with just sticks d a bike he stl claim this video is fake d was posted by a goverment agency to confuse you this os the problem with your average flat earther it s the same as descartes d its demiurge if you assume theres all powerful entity thats trying to shield the truth from you the ev demiurge demon for descartes or the goverment for your friend then y argument against what you believe the truth is be shutdown automaticaly becuase the all powerfull ev entity has always the upper hd this types of theories c never be proven right or wrong d thats why we don t consider them scientific in the end you have to deal with things that you c test d prove i ve tried this before with a flatearther their flat earth model looks a polar map with impenetrable ice wall antarctica forming the circular boundary of the disc the sun supposedly circles the disc overhead my argument was to ask them to simply explain how sunsets work since in their model there should always be a line of sight to the sun no matter where you are on the disc i got accused of being closed minded d brainwashed d no opinions were chged the person i argued with held my other pseudoscientific beliefs besides being a flatearther so i think the core belief is more a general distrust of science my favourite the moon is upside down in australia i m not sure a setting sun convince him the earth isn t flat as they do seem to come up with some odd excuses to combat it that s unfortunate as what s blocking your view when the sun is setting would be the first thing i d try with where is the sun at night as the next line of attack but when somebody does not get to a position by logic you c t get them out of that position by logic does he believe that the moon d sun are globes if so you say that the earth would be that is there someone he trusts who lives at least a few hundred mes to the east or west have them talk on the phone near sunset d find out that the sun isn t setting at the same time if that doesn t convince him nothing you c t most of them believe in flat earth for the religious reason that if god did not create flat earth then hum are just other life form when they just know hum were created by god to be his special snowflakes ask them if they ve ever seen eclipse that isn t circular you c t these people aren t open to being convinced or having their minds chged their belief isn t rooted in mistaken facts that you c correct there s nothing you c say d no proof you c offer that they won t dismiss as fake or reason their way out of everything just gets woven into the conspiracy you ll just be wasting your time d energy don t associate with moroons circumpolar star variation by latitude slinky dropping shows gravity not upward acceleration flight times from argentina to south africa eclipse path prediction thousds of years into the past or future analemma different day d night lengths for different latitudes the sun sets why do you care he s either messing with you or too far gone find people who wt to enjoy real life d go put your energy into being with them in psychology there s a thing called motivated reasoning where people are motivated to form their opinions based almost completely on their emotions even when new facts are introduced motivated reasoning keep individual from chging their mind because their subjective reality is more importt to them th the objective reality around them i d the video of the flat earthers that went out on a big lake with a bright light on a boat at night d binoculars on shore to prove their theory they were surprised by the fact the n t find the light unless they raised it up on the boat the moon appears upside down in the southern hemisphere compared to the northern hemisphere you need to let this friend go d find other friend maybe find a friend that isn t so stupid ask him how he explains sunrise sunset sun disappearing below the horizon from the bottom d timezones at the same time you should understd that you don t need to convince yone you c only share scientific sources d it s up to your friend to accept it or not i don t think he s going to chge his view that nasa lied i wonder if you c fight conspiracies with more conspiracies maybe the reason they lied was for something else i dunno it was too hard so they all just drk beer d got some interns to the images imagine how good of a party you throw with all that money yeah that was it a secret compy wide party with all the booze you c hdle if they say that every proof you offer is faked it s going to be hard to do that ya good luck convincing your friend as i ve also mentioned here a few times in the end this is question for you to pose to ask psychnology rather th ask physics you c talk about rational well accepted rigorously proven endlessly photographed from space kind of physics with your friend all night long unt the cows come home in the morning light but he stl never ever believe you thus the fact that all this is about psychology d not physics this is a also a possibly bad sign about your friend s mental health unfortunately note people who are prone to this kind of obviously bizarre d outldish conspiracy thinking are more susceptible d vulnerable to even more dgerous irrational cult thinking they often embrace this strge thinking because inside they believe it s them special d better that they somehow have profound knoedge that the rest of us don t know because we re all too dim or foolish to see the greater truth that they in their enlightened uprisen intelligence d wisdom see they walk around seeing themselves as the greater wise ones when in reality rather th this making them seem special in a positive way in the eyes of others it instead only s them std out in a glaring repulsive cringe foolish way yeah i had a friend who fell down that particular rabbit hole you won t win y debates by throwing facts in their face or telling them they re wrong ask questions be earnestly interested d ask them how it works for example what s you think the world is flat how does the flat earth theory work where did you hear about flat earth what s you trust those sources why do you distrust sources that say otherwise try to avoid giving your own conclusions leading them or condescending them in y way they probably won t leave the conversation saying they ve chged their mind but you ll sow the seed of doubt in their belief that they may reflect on i me you flip it around d just ask them to show you the edge of our flat earth or have them explain why does the force of gravity always point straight down no matter where you are on a disk it would pull towards its middle so the closer you are to the edge the more it would point sideways they of course won t do that because they don t wt to be reasoned with d the odd excuses are a proof of that i don t think that y argument convince them since it s not really a scientific issue it s a psychological d political issue if one believes that there is a conspiracy whose goal is to hide truth from the rest of the population then one cnot trust ybody any argument that uses stdard science not be trusted because stdard science in their opinion is one way the conspiracy brainwashes us they never believe stdard science unless they find the evidence for themselves they basically would to rebud science from scratch on their own the real problem is trusting other people first have him watch behind the curve on netflix at the very least he ll pick up some sweet hammer trick skls my personal favorite would be to send him up in a weather balloon redbull challenge dude so he c sky dive from the edge of space if your friend wts to know there is a really easy way draw a reaaaaly big trigle on earth if the gles add up to degrees then the earth is flat if they add up to more th degrees then the earth has a curved surface with some fcy math it c be shown that it is a sphere if they add up to less th degrees earth is a ly a hyperbolic saddle point another thing he c do is simple fucking math go to somewhere flat d pick a tall ass ld mark get it s height now walk away in literally y direction unt you c t see it curvature of earth horizon measure the distces d you c come up with a reasonable estimate for the radius of curvature based upon some trigonmetry he try setting up a foucault pendulum get his ass a non stop flight trip that goes most of the way around the world d have him try to figure out how he s experiencing hrs of light he try firing a bullet with a tracer round parallel to the ground on a clear with a high powered scope d rifle after a km or so of flight the coriolis effect kick become obvious as the bullet starts to drift to the left or right depending on the direction you fire it he try to explain why sunsets are red he do the thing they did on behind curve with a laser he c try to explain how we don t detect the four elephts stding on the back of a git turtle which supports the flat earth not to mention the depths below it s turtles all the way down after that point there are a mlion ways your friend doesn t care whether it is or not he just wts to be accepted d be part of ingroup find him a new ingroup i know youre probably asking for a nice physics y wer but might i try a different approach ask ur friend if they would go to ends edge of the earth theme park set on the ends of the flat earth d then ask why they ve never heard of that kind of place existing don t you think if the earth really were flat d that the ends of the earth did exist we d have heard of some compy making money off of it by now only half joking tbh maybe it might work maybe mention some small things like the e tv s effect where something that s moving east is percieved as lighter th when moving west this is because of the chge in the objects gular velocity as it travels with the rotating earth obviusly the mass doesn t chge but the imaginary centrifugal force pointed outwards becomes greater or smaller and this difference is obviously really small but it s measurable i d personally think that small things this that are measurable if you try hard enough might go a long way as argument but i ve never met someone who actually thinks the earth is flat so i don t actually know how well it would work i might have explained this inaccurately i d recommend you look it up yourself there are enough proofs but does he she really wt to know the truth or is he she in denial helium balloon d a go pro might work you c even see the curve if you got sea on the horizon i ve always wted to try a cross country trip where you find the biggest square you c drive plot the distce you drove on a ple d the beginning d end points of the journey should not match up and on a mercator projection it should be distorted d not look a square ymore some cars even have a but in compass to go along with the odometer to help you track it without using gps which be explained away as government controlled what i really wt to do is write some arduino code to log it all for me to increase accuracy since no roads are going to be perfectly straight for the journey get a digital compass or accelerometer module to register direction d either a radar or tachometer module to register speed plot the course d log it to sd card you should be able to dump it into excel d graph it fairly easy you get a vacation together you get to see some sights d you should frame it as you don t know how it turn out that you re in it to find out together if you get in a car for weeks together d they know you re only doing it to prove them wrong that s gonna be awkward vacation i bet i don t know where you are but the us has some big wide open spaces to try this don t bother the evidence is out there it is just they don t wt to look at it lost cause either just let it go or stop associating with unreasonable people if you have a drone you c send it up just after sunset d stl be able to see the sun d olson s in search of a flat earth on youtube might help you same with beyond the curve on netflix neither are short though good luck the most convincing way is with the star rotation but you would need someone in the other hemisphere they are seen as opposite rotations d is not possible to explain with y flat earth theory send him this link folding ideas in search of a flat earth does a good job easy ask them to explain a foucault pendulum on a flat earth that doesnt rotate smash his head into a wall maybe that fix it don t waste your time on this sort of person they ve already made up their mind you won t be able to chge it watch the sun set then go to a higher place d watch ir set again is that friend slot fungible ask him what he thinks astronomers physicists astrophysicists aero astrospace engineers etc actually do what are they being paid for what are they researching is every one of these people lying about their job d their research how have none of these people ever come out with the truth about the earth actually being flat d that mlions of jobs are coverups that s because there haven t been now who has the proof now he c t argue around this one without defying his own logic this isn t dealing with physical evidence it is dealing with probabity d reason if he c t see this then ask him if he has done y of his own research to prove that the earth is flat or has he just listened to others say it is again if he hasn t done y research if he defies this he is defying his own logic therapy here s a few quick d easy ones blow a big soap bubble for them d show them how it s round d not flat this is the same mechic that s the earth round a sphere is the natural shape to hold the most volume in the least amount of space it works for soap bubbles it works for plets ask them how the night cycle would even be possible on a flat disc point out the fact that a single light source a hging lightbulb lights up entire room not just a cone shape of light flat earthers to think that the sun is super small d super close but that doesn t disprove night cycles since the disc would stl be lit up of the time regardless if the earth was flat you c t have some sections lit up d some sections in darkness with a flat disc gravity would be drastically different at the edges of the disc th it would be closer to the center people at the center would experience much higher gravity we do not observe that at all how are we able to see different constations in the night sky in different hemispheres if the earth was flat if it was flat then we would all see the same constations everywhere at the same time c t exactly look behind the disc we are stding on as there is a big disc in the way don t even try they sound really stupid friend honestly it s probably not worth your time depending on his age i hate seeing science chnels on youtube consttly debating flat earthers who are grown adults it s a waste of time d honestly it s upsetting they should use their platform to teach people with open mind science not debate people who never chge their mind the net utity is basically zero debating those dunces whereas producing educational videos may educate thousds upon thousds of people don t get better friends you know how the earth is luminated right depending on the season north or south might get more less sunlight but we c just take the winter scenario to our point more obvious on a globe earth model it s perfect sense for it to be bright where it s bright d dark where it s dark because it s common sense d we c observe it with y round object under a light source try drawing the dark d bright zones on a flat earth model now i don t know if he might have the mental capacity to imagine how it would look but if you draw it you would get a map where it s dark in the very centre the north pole whe almost the entirety of the edges are bright south pole no stretch of imagination or mental gymnastics that i have seen c this seem plausible in y way if he has y open mindedness or at least enough intelligence to understd why that drawing is the way it is you might covert him alternatively he ll just accuse you of lying if he doesn t understd basic logic rather probable or just something up dodge the topic if he realizes the fragity of his claim d start clinging to other points whe disregarding a massive problem with his model one of the best things you c do is remind them this isn t you this is unusual for you consttly it s one of the few methods that breaks people out of a cult the stars seen by people at the south bottom of south america africa d australia as they look towards the south pole see the images in the wer here https physics stackexchge com a i don t believe these people exist so if you have your friend do ama i d appreciate it i have to assume he s trolling you or this is a shitpost how do they explain the time zones gps i m not even going to try to ponder this i d prefer to stick with i don t believe these people exist ask him to define what specific proof would convince him you c t there s plenty of simple experiments that you c do that prove that the world isn t flat if they believe that the world is flat in the face of all the easy verifiable evidence then they don t wt to believe otherwise d there s nothing you c do to chge their mind if at this point in time you need to have that discussion with your friend i d say he is beyond salvation tell them capitalism would have set up amusement parks at the edge so people c swing off of the edge ask them why they believe the earth is flat shift the burden of proof back onto them if they start giving arguments against a spherical earth interrupt them i asked you why you believe the earth is flat not why you disagree with a round plet why do you believe the earth is flat don t argue against ything argue for your belief enjoy the mental gymnastics c they prove it is flat if not they need to re evaluate their thinking i wonder what their explation is for why jupiter s spot goes off the edge of the map d then reappears on the other side or why almost literally everything in the universe appears round send them to space or show them live video from iss the southern hemisphere sees a different star pattern th the northern hemisphere in a dome nothing would stop the light from the sun from being visble everywhere on earth all the time same goes for the moon if they bring up ples sure to let them know that ples fly by keeping a constt altitude maybe don t show the video itself bc the person might think it s condescending but a couple good points https m youtube com watch v aql h aa s vl en other th that it s difficult to win argument with informed person but it s impossible to win argument with a stubbornly ignort person good luck i ll bet you dollars to donuts they re trolling you lots of people looooove to be contrari they get a kick out of watching you try d convince you obvious stuff don t fall for it take him to a port on a large body of water to watch ships come d go also try to hear out his explation of seasons the equator d ask him why toets flow the opposite direction in australia ps show him videos of the toet the easiest argument is that if the earth is flat then people in the southern hemisphere would all be looking in a different direction whe looking to the south if the earth was indeed flat take two cities that are a few hundred mes apart in the southern hemisphere people in each city both should be looking directly south how come they c both see the same star constellations or physicists geologists astronomers d a bunch of other scientists are all lying mlions of people are hiding the truth or thousds d thousds of people who have phd s d devoted their lives to the study of their scientific fields are simply wrong whe some guys who has zero scientific knoedge or experience suddenly knows more about the way things are when someone vehemently denies science there s not a lot you c do besides telling them directly moon is a sphere so are other plets not to mention a star named sun why would earth be flat simple flight to other country curvature of the earth is clearly visible from a ple its not that he dosent have evidence he chooses to throw science away d his own shit stupidity or lack of oxygen to the brain might be the flat culprit ay blackie ay blackie y a john savage it s harious that for years it s been known the earth is round yet educated people to refuse to accept this even with rock hard evidence put in front of them flat earthers you lot are bellends\n"
