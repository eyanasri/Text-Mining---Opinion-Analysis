I'm a bit confused by this curvature test. Please elaborate your bold statements!
(for all I care it could be a square) But don't say we should believe in science and then make a bad test. 

Stripes disappearing makes total sense as proof of curvature, but then wouldn't the water that's in front of the stripes (causing them to disappear) have to be the highest point at the water horizon? Meaning that you shouldn't be able to see any water behind the stripes? Not sure that's the case at 7:44 

I'm not really taking a stance on round or flat, science should be trusted, but this test result doesn't justify the statements made!

Mountains can be at a different altitude, so you would be able to see those. It's like a taller person standing behind a smaller one, you'lll still see the taller person. But water is leveled, there is no different water height in a lake, so all the water behind the water horizon should not be visible, when it's a constant curvature.

Eratosthenes calculated the Earth's circumference without leaving Egypt. He knew that at local noon on the summer solstice in Syene (modern Aswan, Egypt), the Sun was directly overhead. (Syene is at latitude 24°05′ North, near to the Tropic of Cancer, which was 23°42′ North in 100 BC[17]) He knew this because the shadow of someone looking down a deep well at that time in Syene blocked the reflection of the Sun on the water. He then measured the Sun's angle of elevation at noon in Alexandria by using a vertical rod, known as a gnomon, and measuring the length of its shadow on the ground.[18] Using the length of the rod, and the length of the shadow, as the legs of a triangle, he calculated the angle of the sun's rays.[19] This turned out to be about 7°, or 1/50th the circumference of a circle. Taking the Earth as spherical, and knowing both the distance and direction of Syene, he concluded that the Earth's circumference was fifty times that distance.

 @Network-Profi  Your last question is the tell. If the last stripe leaves the frame,  then why there is no water behind it?  It was already over the curvature.  If water is continually flat (waves not withstanding) then you would see all three stripes disappear at the same point and time. This never happens anywhere other than a curved surface. Please remember that 12, 700 miles of diameter is a lot to take in for the human eye. If you are someone who believes In a flat earth, I have a simple request,  

All of the math that is used today, is based on a globe. Instead of using these calculations, please create your own and then show proof. My physics only break down at the event horizon of a black hole. I ACTUALLY WOULD like to see  an experiment with original design (including the numbers), that shows your proof.

I'll give the flerfers that there is something beyond the horizon. It could be the distant shore, however there is no data on the atmospheric conditions and we have no idea of the refractive index, and how much looming exists. For that reason I would not class this as a very scientific experiment, as there are variables that were not controlled. The same goes for all observations made close to the surface of water, there is just too many uncontrolled variables. To perform this with greater certainty, the observation has to be elevated to negate most of the refraction.

Personally this video sincerely does not present the issues that sincerely are reasons as to why flat earthers believe what they do. I personally believe and know from my own research the earth is round. But why others doubt this you guys failed to even present properly. Why not admit what issues exist that they struggle with? Lay out the complete issues and admit where scientist lie or have change their data or have concealed information to the public. Lets talk about geocentrisim and how scientists have lied about acting as if the world rotates when it in fact does not. Your video tries to make flat earthers as being just idiots and yet they have real issues you guys who make these type of videos are to affraid to confront. And for this reason I am ashamed of your version of presenting the facts. Has NASA lied or withheld information or deleted posts from their website? You cant pretend scientist are all truthful and act like they all have told no lies. Either present the full truth or just stay out of the conversation because mocking or presenting partial points is not fair nor acceptable. Present all the truth or stay out of the issue completely and let real truth seekers debunk the lies.

Public and private Universities? There’s so much money invested in this fake space construct.

 @Albert N.  - When Neil DeGrasse Tyson described earth as a pear (not a "pair"), he was trying to help the people watching that interview visualize the earth as being slightly "chubbier" south of the equator.  He didn't mean earth is literally shaped like a pear.

They talk about needing the money, but most just get a clip from the internet and talk over it.

if you want a laugh visit the Niburu channels. They say the world will end in 72 hours, but they still ask you to send them money and they still do the adverts.
It's almost as if they are laughing at gullible fools.

Flat Earthers invoke a magical being they call Perspective, but who should really be called Flerspective, who reaches out and gobbles up the Sun when it gets too close to the horizon in the evening, and spits it out the next morning. That's not how they describe their belief, but that's what it amounts to.

 @Mo Media 98   To answer your first question, you can't. The Sun is never visible directly overhead from any part of the UK, nor from the southernmost point of South Africa. The highest the Sun ever gets in mainland England is 26.5 degrees below the zenith, at noon on the first day of summer, June 21, seen from Lizard Point. At the same time, the Sun will be about 58.5 degrees below the zenith, that is only 31.5 degrees above the horizon, seen from the southernmost point of South Africa. So your question is based on incorrect premises. 

Your second question is simple: frames of reference. The helicopter, just like you and me, the air, and everything else, is moving along with the rotating Earth. You don't fly to the back of the plane at 500 mph when you leave your seat, do you? The helicopter lands on the same spot after hovering for the same reason.

Unfortunately the flight would have to go around the globe going North to South or South to North in order to prove them wrong. I don’t think there are any such commercial flights that fly across Antarctica so this would have to be a private flight. With the flat earth model it’s still possible to fly all the way around the world going east to west or vice versa.

Thanks for the good time, Karakouch Canada! :) I first had to giggle, and then even to laugh at your comment. Don't get me wrong, I'm not ridiculing it, I'm just saying it made me smile and laugh, and this is why:
You wrote "There is no way to convince some humans except if they are part of the experience". But my friend, don't you realize that what you said goes not only for "some" people, but for ALL of them? How do Scientists become convinced in anything if not by being parts of the experience i.e. of an experiment?
What made me giggle and smile was your naivity, and what made me laugh was that you gave me yet another example of how shallow and quasi-scientific those people are, who are fixed on Science the way God-believers are fixed on the Bible :D

 @zysis  Science really means "knowledge" when translated from Latin. But that's what the Latin word "Scientia" means, not what Science IS. The English word "Minister" means "Servant", but that's not what a Minister IS. It's not him to serve the people, but it's the people who serve him. Science MEANS "knowledge", but what it really is - is  GUESSING and EXPLORING. Science is based upon BELIEF. People BELIEVE what Science tells them. They do NOT KNOW any of those things claimed by Science, they BELIEVE what it tells them. In order to KNOW they would have to engage their 5 senses. You know your friends, there is no need for Science or Religion to tell you who your friends are. You don't know how old the Earth is, so Science has to tell you that is 4,6 Billion years old, and your Church has to tell you that it is 6,000 years old, and you will choose which instance you will BELIEVE. if you choose to BELIEVE your Church, you will call it KNOWLEDGE, because it is based upon an ALL-KNOWING GOD. If you choose to BELIEVE in Science, you will call it KNOWLEDGE because it is based upon the ALL-KNOWING SCIENCE, or upon the fact that the word "Science" purely linguistically means "knowledge".

 @Hello Vicki , my friend, do you think the Vikings had a Globe Earth map on their Drakkars when they went to America? Compared to all those thousands and thousands of years, when people would sail the world believing it was flat, those 200 years during which some sailors believed the Earth was a Globe are nothing. Sailing across the world is absolutely possible on any shape of the Earth. Sextants are not dependent on a spherical Earth, for if they were, they wouldn't have been invented by people who believed the Earth was flat. A sextant considers the Polaris, and it works whether people believe it's a star or just a light in the firmament. A sextant can determine the longitude, regardless if people place it onto a flat Earth or a globe Earth map, because longitude is longitude on both maps. If you start your sailing on a boat, you will get from Europe to America regardless whether you believe you're sailing on a flat Earth or on a Globe, because it makes no difference. If it made a difference, ancient people would have never been able to make long journeys on Sea, because they believed the Earth was flat and their devices worked although they were not "adjusted" to a spherical Earth

 @Smooth Drops  no one has flown around the world? People have been doing that for over half a century. I flew from Dallas to Korea, to the Philippines, to Dubai, and finally back to Dallas traveling west the entire time and arrived back at my starting point.

 @Smooth Drops  why would anyone need to fly from pole to pole? To prove that the earth is a sphere? They’ve proven that over and over again and it’s not like it would make any difference if someone had because flat earthers would just say it was faked anyway. So unless Mark Sargent was actually on the plane it would be a pointless effort.

 @Mikewiththebluecar  Being on a plane won’t prove the shape of the Earth, if you have any knowledge at all. 
Also, the fact that someone has travel the Earth east to west or vice versa doesn’t prove the shape of it either, because that’s possible on both models. 
Though, no one has really done it from pole to pole yet.

 @Mikewiththebluecar  Ironically, even flying from Pole to Pole wouldn't do the job, because it would be either completely faked or "accompanied" by lots of fake info, such as footages produced in a studio prior to the flight. Actually, ANY long distance flight could prove that the Earth is not spherical, if it was performed by honest people. But that again would be highly problematic, because if such a flight happened and people could see that the Earth is not a Globe, those people addicted to Science will start to object, claiming that the flight was fake! Fact is, nobody can ever prove anything - at least not to those who stick to an "infused" world-view, regardless if it is the BELIEF about a flat Earth or the BELIEF about a Globe.

 @Predrag L  you can see the curvature of the earth when your flying at 30,000 feet over the ocean. You can see the curvature of the earth as ships go over the horizon. It’s not hard to prove at all.

 @Mikewiththebluecar  So? I have never claimed that the Earth wasn't CURVED. In my opinion the Earth is BULGED yet not spherical. It looks like a 1/16 of a sphere. You know that there is a sphere and a hemisphere, so just go further than that and imagine a sixteenth sphere. Besides, have you been at 30,000 feet over the Ocean? I have, and no curvature was observable. But if you refer to 30,000 meters over the Ocean, I don't know what can be observed from there, because I have never been that high. Have you? Besides, even if the curvature can be observable from such a height, it doesn't disprove my understanding, because the Earth need not be a full sphere so as to be curved. :)

 @Predrag L  I have been 30,000 feet above the ocean before several times flying to & from Hawaii and the Philippines and I could definitely see a curve in the ocean which wouldn’t have any curve at all if the earth was flat because water is self leveling. The reason the ocean is curved is because it’s being pulled towards the center of the earth. Even globebusters made the mistake of admitting that you can’t see the bottom of Santa Barbara Island from Beverly Hills from an elevation of 565 feet. They claimed that according to the earth curvature calculator it shouldn’t be visible at all then they said “but you can clearly see “the majority” of the island. If the earth was flat you’d be able to see all of it including the beach on the island but you can’t because it’s blocked by the curvature of the earth. They also made another mistake when discussing the Nat Geo video where they were testing the curvature of the earth at the Salton lake in California by saying that the boat hadn’t reached the horizon yet which they were correct the boat hadn’t reached the horizon but on a flat earth looking over water there shouldn’t be a horizon in the first place. By admitting that there is a horizon on a lake they already admitted that the horizon does exist thereby confirming that the earth is a sphere and not flat. If the earth was flat you’d be able to see the bank on the other side of the lake. This just goes to show that even when flat earthers see the evidence for themselves they still reject it

I like the way how flat earthers make us transport back in time to the ancient times. Thanks to them, we can experience the thrill the ancients experienced when they were first doing those experiments. Maybe we should claim more things as photoshopped so that regular people can experience the science from the very beginning again. 2000 years of cumulative knowledge is of course hard to absorb at once.

There are mentions of the "dome" of the sky and the ancients were smart enough to know it was  dome to begin with, it still is when you look up lol.

There were some very important statements by the flatearthers:
0:57 "Flatearth shows you that you are not a mistake"
9:05 Mark Seargent: "Sience has had a chance and they aren't putting up a defense"

And that is what it's all about: Psychology. These people are not dumb. They are in distress. They feel meaningless in a world that got so fast and anbstract and complicated. They fear that everything changes and that they will not have a place in this new world. and so they ignore evrything but this one truth they found for themselves. And they cling to it with all their power: the earth is flat and none of that scary incomprehensible "sientism" is true. 

I am no psychologist, I just read a few things about it so I'm no expert at all. But I am convinced that the real challenge as a scociety is not explaining flat earthers why their believe is physically impossible. Because that is so obvious that is hurts to look at their models of the flat earth. I mean, just watch a sunset and the whole model is debunked. No, the real challenge is to find the answer to questions like: How do we build a just society so thay people don't feel so lost anymore? And how do we help those who are so much in distress that they would graps at straws like this flawed flat earth "theorie"?

First of all what these flat earthers keep forgetting that their model of a flat earth makes absolutely no sense in everyday sunsets. If the earth were flat, the sun would just recede high in the sky and get smaller and smaller until it fades away, it absolutely would not retain the same angler size and set below the horizon.

Not to forget Lunar Eclipses that these idiots will never address, what is that object that is making the shadow on the moon, and when you look at its side, it has a curved shape, and what other shape is produces curves than a sphere

I know for myself, without gravity. Objects form in a sphere. We learn that from experiments in space. I don't see any liquid flattening as a unhindered state even with pressure being applied like on the space station. 
The sphere is a natural state that becomes more apparent the larger an object is because of the objects self-generated gravitational pull based off density that intensifies 2 a singular point. Because the point has no Direction, creates the sphere

Also, how do they explain that the Artcic and Antarctic are both extremely cold, while the equator is much warmer? What about the seasons, or the fact that in the southern hemisphere you see different stars than you do from the northern hemisphere? How do they explain the fact that days vary in length throughout the year, and that those variations are extreme (and opposite) at the extremes of the two hemispheres? You've got to wonder if they are all just trolling.

This can be proved one way or the other, with an accurate map of Australia. As a large land mass in the southern hemisphere, the shape of Australia would differ greatly depending on whether the Earth is a sphere of a flat circular disc. You wouldn't need to rely on any information from scientists, governments or the all powerful lizard people, you could just measure it, like people have done around the World for thousands of years. If someone can provide me with a detailed flat Earth map with a scale, I'd be very happy to look at it.

Let me make this easy for you. If the earth was indeed flat, or even close to being flat, you could mount a telescope on a building in New York, and look across the Atlantic to see Big Ben in London. The actual line of sight between those two points is a straight line that enters the ocean before the horizon and continues until it is thousands of feet below the surface, and continues in that straight line until it reaches Big Ben. A flat earth would mean that line of sight would never enter the ocean.

In their model their South Pole is the whole circle instead of just one point. So, if your plane ride happened to fly over the south pole, how do you explain to passengers that you have to fly over the south pole for like twenty hours continuously with out ever getting out of the south pole for those twenty hours? Try it yourself on their map. Start at the tip of Chile and end up in Australia. You first head for the south pole. At the south pole, you have to circle half the flat earth (without ever leaving the south pole) and then continue to Australia (after having been stuck at the south pole for about 2o hours).

I've been living my life for almost 30 years with science and faith. "Stupid is forever" -Been around with a family friend who got brainwashed and recently believes that the earth is flat. I feel bad, because this kind of people exist spreading false information and make others believe to the point that life almost non-existent. When I was stressed out, sometimes I just watch live views from the ISS to see some cool stuff like the stunning Northern Lights, or just watch a sunset. SpaceX doin a starlink routine also inspires me. 

I still believe that if they open their minds, the information will flow like a river.

Oh and one of my favorite Bible Verse:

It is He who sits above the circle of the earth ,
And its inhabitants are like grasshoppers,
Who stretches out the heavens like a curtain,
And spreads them out like a tent to dwell in.

On 4th December there was a total solar eclipse which was visible only in extreme South locations, particularly Antarctica. It was streamed live from the Union Glacier Base near the shores of the Weddell Sea, which is basically south of South America, on several websites including NASA's.  In addition to over 70 people who travelled there to watch it, two plane loads of eclipse chasers, from Western Australia and Chile (on opposite sides of the disc) flew South to get a good view of it from 30,000 feet. It was also observed as a partial eclipse from South Africa and Melbourne.

When it was observed in Australia it was just before sunset and people looked West to watch it. In contrast, folks in South Africa had to look Eastwards as it was early morning. 

But here's the BIG THING. The people observing it from the Union Glacier Base watched it when it was technically around midnight! At this time of the year the sun doesn't set in Antartica. It just goes around in circles about 15 degrees above the horizon. And to film the eclipse, the cameras streaming it were pointed SOUTH! Over the South Pole! In the opposite direction to the "centre of the disc"!

When totality was happening over Antarctica, it was around noon in India. The sun would have been at it's highest in the Indian sky.

How is all of this, happening MORE OR LESS SIMULTANEOUSLY, explainable in the flat earth model? Try mapping this out on the flat earth disc!

Then there is the stunning "eclipse over Antarctica" image from the NASA climate satellite, orbiting around a million miles from earth, that photographed the totality shadow over the Weddell Sea. You can clearly see how the global earth model clearly explains this in it's entirety.

What will flat earthers say to explain this? All fake? How? Why?

I don't think the boat experiment was conducted correctly. It should have been in a place where the water is the line of the horizon. Here  you can still see land behind the lake, so it won't show the boat hiding under the line of the horizon. Nonetheless, even if it was done on an ocean flat earth believers would still say it was heat, perspective etc.

If we have half a glass of water, and tell normal people to describe it, they would either say that the glass is half full or that the glass is half empty. But if you do the same with a Flat Earther, they would say that the glass is flat because the water is sticking on it 

They would then go on to feel proud about themselves, thinking that their statement made sense.

If the Earth is flat then why are all other celestial objects are spherical? Moon, the Mars, the sun, Jupiter and so on. It seems crazy to believe that the Earth is flat yet every other large object in the universe is a sphere. Another thing to consider is if the Earth is flat you’d be able to see England from the United States with a telescope but you can’t see beyond the horizon because of the curvature

There’s a much simpler explanation to proving that the earth is round and not flat. Simply using Euclidean geometry and three right angles you can form a triangle on a sphere like the Earth. However on a flat earth it would be impossible to make a triangle using three right angles. So there you have it the earth is scientifically proven using math that it is not a flat earth after all, it’s a sphere shaped planet.

A flat earth wouldn't have an atmosphere. Since they don't believe in gravity.
Earths gravity keeps the atmosphere in place.
All stars and planets have a core which creates a magnetic field of their own.
Thus making a flat earth and life, except for microscopic lifeforms impossible.

The real problem is people don't like to feel insignificant. They'll often search for ways to suggest that there is inherent meaning in their lives. Many people do not want to accept the reality that they are not intrinsically important. When you search, keep asking questions, keep going deeper, your still faced with the same, inherent issues if you follow flat Earth conspiracies. How did whatever beings that lay beyond the flat Earth come into existence? What are their laws of physics like, then, if they do not live in a manufactured environment, as we apparently do? If the beings outside of the flat Earth dome are born in whatever natural way the outer universe sees fit, then what gives them the significance that we are searching for? Then the question is: if an insignificant (natural, randomly formed) "Creator" created us, doesn't that make us even less significant? Those who believe in the flat Earth claim significance by something larger forming us, but that larger being does not have the same advantage to believe in itself. It releases a burden from peoples' lives to believe in the flat Earth conspiracy, and other similar ideas like it, until you keep looking deeper. The truth that we are not significant may hurt at first, until you realize that the real freeing thing is that you can define what significance means to you (both in terms of what is important to you, and what kind of ideas of self you want to be known/remembered), you choose what matters in your life, and you can have the impact your searching for, because you are not bounded by anything but yourself. Your life as an individual is interpreted entirely differently from that of another, you may give significance to your family, your friends, your ideals, but another individual may never even have contact with anything from your life, not even having the opportunity to deem it as good or bad, because it truly is that insignificant to them. The choice of what you define to be important in your life is taken away if you believe that there is something grand out there, orchestrating all of known reality.

from my simple mind the easiest way to discover for your self that the earth is spherical (round-ish) is  in order to see other objects in space as round (spherical) is  back to the theory that the earth is the center of the universe and every object that is round (spherical) is flat and tilted towards earth in order to be seen as round (spherical) . therefore, with it being proven that the earth in not the center of the solar system and definitely not the universe the only logical conclusion is the the earth is not flat .

It's all about symbolism, isn't it. "The earth is flat" is a metaphysical statement, that questions necessity to confirm to scientific advances in order to be a good person and live a fulfilling life. Having a harmless irrational belief doesn't make you a bad person, I guess that's the point here. And those people need to be approached on a spiritual level, if it's important to convince them, though I think it's not - let them think whatever. It's not more irrational than spirits, or God-given right of certain people to certain lands.

Then he says "it is a dangerous belief" why?  because no more funding, :),  well, the minute  funding stops to the rich powerful organizations then I guess it is rather dangerous for them, they will have to go live just like the rest of the population that funds them, funding here is  keyword. I mean the answers are there, you just have to puzzle it together to get to the really core of it.  Even Mark S. says something to this effect when he says those who benefit from this the most are those high level people that control the economies of the world, but then again those are the ones who also have the most to loose if things take a different route, a more honest approach. 

Well I think a lot of flat earthers are doing exactly that, observing with all their senses and finding the new or one can say resurfaced  earth model contradicts what science has peddled for 2000 years. Perhaps some new awakening?  Truth is self evident without the jargon and mumbo jumbo. Science offers a lot to the prosperity of the human race,  when done honestly and ethically, but it also harms  society when knowingly gives people false illusion of a world that is not so. When people wake up then I suppose there should be real concern, because imagine if you are of ethical and moral believes /roots, and find out one day you were complete lied to. How would you feel?  

And although many flat earthers, as are many globe earthers, really lost in translation by so many factors, and perhaps a lot of contradiction,  some I think really get it, and many simply regurgitate what they hear, but most miss the whole picture.  The answer is really simple but let me summarize it for you:

The scientist says that the tunnels design had to account for one and a half meters that the earth curvature drops in four kilometers...case closed...

Do they really think the earth is flat? [Apparently so]
Flat-Earth videos and conspiracy theories. One conspiracy sees ordinary people stand against a ruling elite of corrupt politicians and celebrities. Knowledge is power, and this theory argues that those in power conspire to keep knowledge for themselves by distorting the basic nature of reality.
Random acts of kindness do more than people think. Not only does the recipient of a good deed generally feel more positive after these interactions, the study found that they also spread this kindness and generosity to others.
Do they really think the earth is hollow? [Apparently so]
Study: Consumers who avoid fast food do so not because they think it is unhealthy, but because eating it causes them guilt and resisting the "sin" gives them a sense of accomplishment. Furthermore, researchers found such non-regular consumers may approach fast food when experiencing time pressure.
Most Americans do not think that Black people are any more likely to be affected by pollution than white people, despite significant evidence that racism is a root cause of environmental injustice in the United States, a survey has found.
Try to visualize gathering ALL of the Earth's water and atmosphere into one huge globe for each of them. How big do you think they would be? I was way off. This is how big they would be ....
People often cry tears of joy in the throes of emotion. A new study shows that dogs do, too: they become teary-eyed when they are reunited with their humans. Caninesâ€™ weeping makes them the first non-human animal known to shed happy tears. The hormone oxytocin is probably responsible.


You cannot reason someone out of something he or she was not reasoned into.
"Assuming he is opened to be reasoned with.
Cheap: grab a good spotting scope or binoculars, go to a port, ideally with a lot of big sailing ships, look at them as they pass under the horizon, you will see how the keel disapear first before the mast.
Medium cheap: buy or build yourself a sextan and get to a place with a mountain not too far from the sea. measure at the bottom, doa bit of climbing, measure at the top, boom, calculate the radius of the Earth without walking between Alexandria and Syene.
A bit more expensive: join or fund an amateur rocket club and take pictures yourselves."
"I'm not sure a setting sun will convince him the earth isn't flat as they do seem to come up with some odd excuses to combat it.
And they'll keep coming up with odder and odder excuses, even ones that are patently ridiculous, rather than give up this idea that makes them feel like they're special because they know ""the truth.""
The best you can do, I think, is to get a lot of detail about what he believes and try to find a contradiction in it. Like, many of them believe the Sun is a small, close globe that circles around and shines down like a spotlight. Two easily verifiable contradictions of this are a) the Sun sets, and b) it never changes its apparent size in the sky, even though, according to the flat Earth model, its distance varies considerably throughout a day.
One nice direct method is to set up a camera pointing out to a sea horizon on a clear day, preferably from a good height, then add a spirit level to the view and line it up against the horizon. If you take a photo and then horizontally (but not vertically) compress the image, the curvature is pretty easy to see against the straight spirit level (this rules out any in-camera effect)."
"Most often the reasons to join a conspiracy theory are not the misleading arguments. It's to join a group finding fellas or/and the feeling of being significant and not believing that while facing big problems the government/people does/do nothing.
That said, one obvious fact would be that in a time lapse the stars on the northern hemisphere and the stars on the south hemisphere rotate in different directions.
Different people on different southern continent (Africa, South America, Australia) can see the southern cross (a star constellation) at the same time. Wouldn't be possible on a plain. Also the Southern cross cannot be seen from nordern hemisphere. The north star cannot be seen by the southern hemisphere."
"Ask them how gravity works. The typical response from flat earthers is that the disk-earth is accelerating upwards at 9.81ms/s.
In reality, g (the local gravitational field strength) varies by around 1% due to the fact that the earth is technically an oblate spheroid and differences in rock density in different areas. As far as I'm aware, there is no flat earth model that can explain this."
"The problem with flat Earthers is not that they believe the earth is flat. Itâ€™s their destructive combination of boredom, Mis-placed search for meaning, Pride, and stubbornness.
My advice is to model the virtues contrary to those vices, suggest ways of finding meaning and community that compete with the flat earthers and show the kind of respect for them as a person that will make them feel more comfortable changing their view in light of your arguments."
"Flat earthers seem to like those kind of experiments that are performed by everyday people and simple enough to be understood without any prior knoweledge so I'd show your friend this linked video. (and another proof for his axiom) It's the Eratosthenes proof with just 2 sticks and a bike.
He could still claim this video is fake and was posted by a goverment agency to confuse you. This os the problem with your average flat earther, it's the same as Descartes and its demiurge, if you assume theres an all powerful entity thats trying to shield the truth from you (the evil demiurge demon for Descartes or the goverment for your friend) then any argument against what you believe the truth is will be shutdown automaticaly becuase the all powerfull evil entity has always the upper hand.
This types of theories can never be proven right or wrong and thats why we don't consider them scientific, in the end you have to deal with things that you can test and prove."
"I've tried this before with a flatearther. Their flat earth model looks like a polar map with an impenetrable ice wall (Antarctica) forming the circular boundary of the disc. The sun supposedly circles the disc overhead.
My argument was to ask them to simply explain how sunsets work since, in their model, there should always be a line of sight to the sun no matter where you are on the disc. I got accused of being closed-minded and brainwashed and no opinions were changed. The person I argued with held many other pseudoscientific beliefs besides being a flatearther, so I think the core belief is more like a general distrust of science."
My favourite: the moon is upside down in Australia.
"I'm not sure a setting sun will convince him the earth isn't flat as they do seem to come up with some odd excuses to combat it.
That's unfortunate, as ""what's blocking your view when the sun is setting"" would be the first thing I'd try. With ""where is the sun at night"" as the next line of attack.
But when somebody does not get to a position by logic, you can't get them out of that position by logic."
Does he believe that the moon and sun are globes? If so, you could say that the earth would be like that.
"Is there someone he trusts who lives at least a few hundred miles to the east or west? Have them talk on the phone near sunset and find out that the sun isn't setting at the same time.
If that doesn't convince him, nothing will."
You can't. Most of them believe in flat earth for the religious reason that if God did not create flat earth, then humans are just another life form when they just know humans were created by God to be His special snowflakes.
Ask them if theyâ€™ve ever seen an eclipse that isnâ€™t circular.
You can't. These people aren't open to being convinced or having their minds changed. Their belief isn't rooted in mistaken facts that you can correct. There's nothing you can say and no proof you can offer that they won't dismiss as fake or reason their way out of. Everything just gets woven into the conspiracy. You'll just be wasting your time and energy.

"Why do you care?
He's either messing with you or too far gone.

In psychology thereâ€™s a thing called motivated reasoning, where people are motivated to form their opinions based almost completely on their emotions. Even when new facts are introduced motivated reasoning will keep an individual from changing their mind because their subjective reality is more important to them than the objective reality around them.
I liked the video of the flat earthers that went out on a big lake with a bright light on a boat at night and binoculars on shore to â€˜proveâ€™ their theory. They were surprised by the fact the couldnâ€™t find the light unless they raised it up on the boat.
The moon appears upside down in the southern hemisphere, compared to the northern hemisphere.
You need to let this friend go, and find another friend. Maybe find a friend that isn't so stupid.
Ask him how he explains sunrise/sunset (sun disappearing below the horizon from the bottom) and timezones at the same time
You should understand that you donâ€™t need to convince anyone, you can only share scientific sources and itâ€™s up to your friend to accept it or not.
I don't think he's going to change his view that NASA lied. I wonder if you can fight conspiracies with more conspiracies? Maybe the reason they lied was for something else.... I dunno? It was too hard so they all just drank beer and got some interns to make the images. Imagine how good of a party you could throw with all that money! yeah that was it, a secret company wide party with all the booze you can handle!
If they say that every proof you offer is faked, it's going to be hard to do that.
"Ya good luck convincing your friend! :(
As I've also mentioned here a few times:
In the end, this is question for you to pose to ask psychnology rather than ask physics!
You can talk about rational, well accepted, rigorously proven, endlessly-photographed-from-space-kind-of-physics with your friend all night long, until the cows come home in the morning light, but he still will NEVER-EVER believe you.
Thus the fact that all this is about psychology and not physics.
This is a also a possibly bad sign about your friend's mental health, unfortunately. :(
NOTE:
People who are prone to this kind of obviously bizarre and outlandish conspiracy thinking are more susceptible and vulnerable to even more dangerous irrational cult like thinking.
They often embrace this strange thinking because inside they believe it makes them ""special"" and ""better""...
That they somehow have profound knowledge that the rest of us don't know because we're all too dim or foolish to see the ""greater truth"" that they, in their enlightened uprisen intelligence and wisdom see.
They walk around seeing themselves as the greater wise ones--when in reality rather than this making them seem special in a positive way in the eyes of others, it instead only makes them stand out in a glaring repulsive/cringe/foolish way."
"Yeah I had a friend who fell down that particular rabbit hole.
You won't win any debates by throwing facts in their face or telling them they're wrong. Ask questions, be earnestly interested and ask them how it works. For example:
What makes you think the world is flat?
How does the flat earth theory work?
Where did you hear about flat earth?
What makes you trust those sources?
Why do you distrust sources that say otherwise?
Try to avoid giving your own conclusions, leading them, or condescending them in any way.
They probably won't leave the conversation saying they've changed their mind. But you'll sow the seed of doubt in their belief that they may reflect on."
"I mean, you could flip it around and just ask them to show you the edge of our flat Earth. Or have them explain why does the force of gravity always point straight down, no matter where you are. On a disk, it would pull towards its middle, so the closer you are to the edge, the more it would point sideways.
They, of course, won't do that because they don't want to be reasoned with and the odd excuses are a proof of that."
"I don't think that any argument will convince them since it's not really a scientific issue. It's a psychological and political issue. If one believes that there is a conspiracy whose goal is to hide truth from the rest of the population, then one cannot trust anybody.
Any argument that uses standard science will not be trusted because standard science, in their opinion, is one way the conspiracy brainwashes us. They will never believe standard science unless they find the evidence for themselves.
They basically would like to rebuild science from scratch on their own.
The real problem is trusting other people."
"First have him watch Behind the Curve on netflix, at the very least he'll pick up some sweet hammer trick skills.
My personal favorite would be to send him up in a weather balloon like redbull challenge dude so he can sky dive from the edge of space.
If your friend wants to know, there is a really easy way: Draw a reaaaaly big triangle on Earth. If the angles add up to 180 degrees, then the Earth is flat. If they add up to more than 180 degrees, then the earth has a curved surface--with some fancy math, it can be shown that it is a sphere. If they add up to less than 180 degrees, Earth is a likely a hyperbolic saddle point.
Another thing he can do is simple fucking math. Go to somewhere flat and pick a tall ass land mark. Get it's height. Now walk away in literally any direction until you can't see it (curvature of Earth->horizon). Measure the distances and you can come up with a reasonable estimate for the radius of curvature based upon some trigonmetry.
He could try setting up a foucault pendulum.
Get his ass a non stop flight trip that goes most of the way around the world and have him try to figure out how he's experiencing 17-20 hrs of day light.
He could try firing a bullet with a tracer round parallel to the ground on a clear day with a high powered scope and rifle--after a km or so of flight, the Coriolis effect will kick become obvious as the bullet starts to drift to the left or right (depending on the direction you fire it).
He could try to explain why sunsets are red.
He could do the thing they did on behind curve with a laser.
He can try to explain how we don't detect the four elephants standing on the back of a giant turtle which supports the flat earth (not to mention the depths below; it's turtles all the way down after that point).
There are a million ways; your friend doesn't care whether it is or not--he just wants to be accepted and be part of an ingroup.
Find him a new ingroup."
i know youre probably asking for a nice physics-y answer, but might i try a different approach? ask ur friend if they would go to an "ends/edge of the earth" theme park set on the ends of the flat earth. and then ask why they've never heard of that kind of place existing. don't you think, if the earth really were flat, and that the ends of the earth did exist, we'd have heard of some company making money off of it by now? (only half joking tbh maybe it might work)
"Maybe mention some small things? Like the EÃ¶tvÃ¶s effect, where something that's moving East is percieved as lighter than when moving west. This is because of the change in the objects angular velocity as it travels with the rotating earth. (Obviusly the mass doesn't change but the imaginary centrifugal force pointed outwards becomes greater or smaller. And this difference is obviously really small. But it's measurable)
I'd personally think that small things like this that are measurable if you try hard enough might go a long way as an argument. But I've never met someone who actually thinks the earth is flat so I don't actually know how well it would work.
(I might have explained this inaccurately I'd recommend you look it up yourself)"
There are enough proofs, but does he/she really want to know the truth or is he/she in denial?
Helium balloon and a go pro might work. You can even see the curve if you got sea on the horizon
"I've always wanted to try a cross-country trip where you find the biggest square you can drive. Plot the distance you drove on a plane and the beginning and end points of the journey should not match up. And on a Mercator projection, it should be distorted and not look like a square anymore. Some cars even have a built-in compass to go along with the odometer to help you track it without using GPS which could be explained away as government-controlled.
What I really want to do is write some Arduino code to log it all for me to increase accuracy since no roads are going to be perfectly straight for the journey. Get a digital compass or accelerometer module to register direction and either a radar or tachometer module to register speed. Plot the course and log it to an SD card. You should be able to dump it into Excel and graph it fairly easily.
You get a vacation together, you get to see some sights, and you should frame it as you don't know how it will turn out. That you're in it to find out together. If you get in a car for 2 weeks together and they know you're only doing it to prove them wrong, that's gonna be an awkward vacation I bet. I don't know where you are, but the US has some big, wide-open spaces to try this"
Donâ€™t bother, the evidence is out there it is just they donâ€™t want to look at it.
Lost cause. Either just let it go or stop associating with unreasonable people.
If you have a drone you can send it up just after sunset and still be able to see the sun.
Dan Olson's in search of a flat earth on YouTube might help you, same with beyond the curve on Netflix. neither are short though. good luck
The most convincing way is with the star rotation, but you would need someone in the other hemisphere. They are seen as opposite rotations and is not possible to explain with any flat earth theory
Send him this link.
Folding Ideas' In Search of A Flat Earth does a good job
Easy. Ask them to explain a Foucault pendulum on a flat Earth that doesnt rotate.
Smash his head into a wall maybe that will fix it
Donâ€™t waste your time on this sort of person, theyâ€™ve already made up their mind, you wonâ€™t be able to change it
Watch the sun set, then go to a higher place and watch ir set again
Is that friend slot fungible?
Ask him what he thinks astronomers, physicists, astrophysicists, aero/astrospace engineers, etc., actually do. What are they being paid for? What are they researching? Is every one of these people lying about their job and their research? How have none of these people ever come out with the â€œtruthâ€ about the earth actually being flat and that millions of jobs are coverups? Thatâ€™s because there havenâ€™t been. Now who has the proof now? He canâ€™t argue around this one without defying his own logic. This isnâ€™t dealing with physical evidence, it is dealing with probability and reason. If he canâ€™t see this, then ask him if he has done any of his own research to prove that the earth is flat, or has he just listened to others say it is. Again (if he hasnâ€™t done any research) if he defies this, he is defying his own logic.
Therapy.
"Here's a few quick and easy ones:
Blow a big soap bubble for them and show them how it's round and not flat. This is the same mechanic that makes the earth round. A sphere is the natural shape to hold the most volume in the least amount of space. It works for soap bubbles, it works for planets.
ask them how the day/night cycle would even be possible on a flat disc? Point out the fact that a single light source (like a hanging lightbulb) lights up an entire room. Not just a cone shape of light. Flat earthers like to think that the sun is super small and super close, but that doesn't disprove day/night cycles since the disc would still be lit up 100% of the time regardless if the earth was flat. You can't have some sections lit up, and some sections in darkness with a flat disc.
gravity would be drastically different at the edges of the disc than it would be closer to the center. People at the center would experience much higher gravity. We do not observe that at all
how are we able to see different constilations in the night sky in different hemispheres if the earth was flat? If it was flat, then we would all see the same constilations everywhere at the same time. Can't exactly look behind the disc we are standing on... As there is a big disc in the way."
Donâ€™t even tryâ€¦they sound really stupid.
â€œFriendâ€?
"Honestly, itâ€™s probably not worth your time, depending on his age.
I hate seeing science channels on YouTube constantly debating flat earthers who are grown adults. Itâ€™s a waste of time, and honestly, itâ€™s upsetting. They should use their platform to teach people with an open mind science - not debate people who will never change their mind. The net utility is basically zero debating those dunces, whereas producing educational videos may educate thousands upon thousands of people."
Don't. Get better friends.
"You know how the earth is illuminated right? Depending on the season, north or south might get more/less sunlight, but we can just take the winter scenario to make our point more obvious.
On a globe earth model, it makes perfect sense for it to be bright where it's bright and dark where it's dark because it's common sense and we can observe it with any round object under a light source.
Try drawing the dark and bright zones on a flat earth model.
Now I don't know if he might have the mental capacity to imagine how it would look like, but if you draw it you would get a map where it's dark in the very centre, the north pole, while almost the entirety of the edges are bright (south pole)
No stretch of imagination or mental gymnastics that I have seen can make this seem plausible in any way.
If he has any open-mindedness or at least enough intelligence to understand why that drawing is the way it is, you might covert him.
Alternatively, he'll just accuse you of lying if he doesn't understand basic logic (rather probable) or just make something up/dodge the topic if he realizes the fragility of his claim and start clinging to other points while disregarding a massive problem with his model."
One of the best things you can do is remind them 'this isn't like you. This is unusual for you.' like constantly. It's one of the few methods that breaks people out of a cult.
The stars seen by people at the south (bottom of south america, africa, and australia) as they look towards the south pole. See the images in the answer here https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/435145/157704
I donâ€™t believe these people exist. So, if you could have your friend do an AMA Iâ€™d appreciate it. I have to assume heâ€™s trolling youâ€¦ or this is a shitpost. How do they explain the time zones? GPS? â€¦ Iâ€™m not even going to try to ponder this. Iâ€™d prefer to stick with I donâ€™t believe these people exist.
Ask him to define what specific proof would convince him.
You can't. There's plenty of simple experiments that you can do that will prove that the world isn't flat. If they believe that the world is flat in the face of all the easily verifiable evidence then they don't want to believe otherwise and there's nothing you can do to change their mind.
If at this point in time you need to have that discussion with your friend, Iâ€™d say he is beyond salvation
Tell them capitalism would have set up amusement parks at the edge so people can swing off of the edge
Ask them why they believe the earth is flat. Shift the burden of proof back onto them. If they start giving arguments against a spherical earth, interrupt them. "I asked you why you believe the earth is flat, not why you disagree with a round planet. Why do you believe the earth is flat? Don't argue against anything, argue for your belief." Enjoy the mental gymnastics.
can they prove it is flat? if not they need to re-evaluate their thinking.
"I wonder what their explanation is for why Jupiterâ€™s spot â€œgoes off the edge of the mapâ€ and then reappears on the other side.
Or why almost literally everything in the universe appears round."
Send them to space? Or show them live video from ISS?
"The southern hemisphere sees a different star pattern than the northern hemisphere.
In a dome nothing would stop the light from the sun from being visble everywhere on earth, all the time, same goes for the moon.
If they bring up planes make sure to let them know that planes fly by keeping a constant altitude."
"Maybe don't show the video itself bc the person might think it's condescending, but a couple good points: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AQl8h7Aa75s&vl=en
Other than that, it's difficult to win an argument with an informed person, but it's impossible to win an argument with a stubbornly ignorant person. Good luck!"
Iâ€™ll bet you dollars to donuts theyâ€™re trolling you. Lots of people looooove to be contrarian. They get a kick out of watching you try and convince you obvious stuff. Donâ€™t fall for it.
Take him to a port on a large body of water to watch ships come and go also try to hear out his explanation of seasons the equator and ask him why toilets flow the opposite direction in Australia ps show him videos of the toilet
"The easiest argument is that if the Earth is flat, then people in the Southern Hemisphere would all be looking in a different direction while looking to the south if the Earth was indeed flat. Take two cities that are a few hundred miles apart in the Southern Hemisphere. People in each city both should be looking directly south. How come they can both see the same star constellations?
Or physicists, geologists, astronomers, and a bunch of other scientists are all lying? Millions of people are hiding the truth? Or thousands and thousands of people who have PHD's and devoted their lives to the study of their scientific fields are simply wrong while some guys who has zero scientific knowledge or experience suddenly knows more about the way things are?"
When someone vehemently denies science, there's not a lot you can do besides telling them directly.
"Moon is a sphere so are other planets ,not to mention a star named ""Sun"" ,why would earth be flat ? Simple flight to another country ,curvature of the earth is clearly visible from a plane ..
Its not that he dosent have evidence, he chooses to throw science away and make his own shit ..Stupidity or lack of oxygen to the brain might be the flat culprit..."
